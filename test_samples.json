Mukur gave me several suggestions and said, \n“whether you’d take the information or not we will see later.

He nicely said, “what would you do with the letter. This would cause \nunnecessary problems. It’s better that you take the manual list. It’s not going to cost much.” I \ntried to persuade him to give me the letter, but he did not agree. So I took the photocopy of \nthe manual list for Tk 1300. \n \nBut I utilized an advice of Mukur.

I \nwanted to run a nice story. But my editor said, forget it. It’s no use making the administration \nunhappy. \n \nI did not stop making good reports using the RTI. In addition I had to teach officials the law. \nWorking with this law is fun. But there are problems too. People who knew me well and \ngreeted me with a smile now pretend they do not know me.

But if it is widely used, then it \nwould ensure transparency, accountability and good governance in the country. This is my \nrealization after applying the law upon receiving training from the MRDI. \n \nHow I learnt about RTI \nAt 10 pm June 21, 2011, I got a call from the Shokaler Khobor office. It was National Editor \nTarikul Islam. He asked me to attend a two-day workshop in Dhaka. I took part there. There \nwere 22 others from different districts to l earn about the RTI. I returned to Rangamati and \n \n \n38\nprepared an information request application with  my newly acquired knowledge. To check \nmy flaws, I e-mailed my form to MRDI’s responsible officer Farhana Afroze. She corrected a \nfew things. I was hesitant about filing the application as I am a junior and new in journalism. I \nalso saw that the person to whom I woul d file the application had good terms with my \nseniors. This stopped me from filing the application. \n \nSix months later I got another call from my office on January 15, 2012 asking me to join yet \nanother two-day workshop in Dhaka on January 18-19. I attended it and committed to apply \nthe RTI act. \n",
            " to be given by any organization. But one must have a clear \nconcept about the law. I am saying this on the basis of my experience with the DC office \nover brick kiln. I filed my application on March 28, 2012 asking for on what legal and policy \nbasis the brick kilns were allowed to operate in 10 upazila of Rangamati district and its \nassociated details. \n \nDesignated Officer Shafiqul Islam did not want to give most part of the information that I \nwanted. He gave me this message 10 days later. He said that he could tell where these brick \nkilns are—but my asking for other information was tantamount to harassing him. I told him \nthat as per the law, he should give it in writing what information he would not give to me. \nThis made him somewhat angry. He said, because of the good terms with me, he was \noffering me information against my first question—which I was refusing. After saying this, he \ncalled a peon and asked him to bring the RTI Act book. The peon brought in two books. After \nflipping through some pages, his voice became frustrated, “the government makes law just \nlike that. What’s the point of making a law if it is not implemented.” Afterwards I told him that \nif he refused to give me the information, I will file for an appeal. This saddened him. \n \nOn April 23, I finally got my information. the an swer was: there is no brick kiln in Rangamati. \nIf there is any, it is illegal. This answer addresses all other questions. \n \nThrough this experience, I learnt that if you do not have ideas about the act, officials like \nShafiqul Islam will get away denying your rights—although they themselves do not know \nmuch about the law. \n \nIf you did not get your information after y ou applied and sat back, negative attitude \ndoes not help \nAs I have seen, if you wait for things to happen after application, you will not get information. \nAnd if you develop a negative view about the authority in such a situation, it does not help. \nIts because often your application can get buried under other official works. A negative \nattitude will be a mistake. It happened to me. When I did not get information 15 days after I \napplied for the third time at the Zila Parishad, I thought the Information Officer is ignoring me. \nLater I thought of contacting the DO and found out that I was wrong all along. \n \nI had to give extra time after filing an appeal \nI had to remind the Appellate Authority after filing my appeal and the Appellate Authority, \nwhich was the Rangamati Zila Parishad Ch airman, sought one week’s time and had given \nme the information. I could have lodged a complaint with the Information Commission after \nexpiry of my deadline. That would have taken longer time for me to get my information. \n \n \n \n \n \n40\nTransparency, accountability and good governance have to be ensured: \nI, Himel Chakma, am an individual. Applying the RTI Act just by myself is not enough. My \nexperience says that if hundreds of Himels apply this law, then it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance. People want to know many things. This wish to know is \nnot enough if it is confined within their thoughts. I believe the RTI Act is not just for the \njournalists to apply, but for all to exercise in order to make it a tool to ensure good \ngovernance. Otherwise it will remain as a law only. \n \n \n \n \nClose to a legal battle in \nsearch of information \n \nMotahar Hossain, Senior Staff Reporter, Dainik Gramer Kagoj, Jessore \n \nTwenty five years into my journalism career, t he RTI Act gave me the opportunity to sharpen \nmy profession as well as become a teacher. I become a teacher of the RTI Act for people \ncoming to me with various problems. From 2009, the MRDI created the scope for me to \nbecome an apprentice teacher. \n \nOnce I faced many rejections in getting information from different offices due to \ngovernment’s secrecy law or instructions of the higher authorities. I joined Dainik Gramer \nKagoj in 1999 and worked with various strategies and professional instructions given by my \neditor Mobinul Islam Mobin to gather informati on. Once I turned to",
            " late education minister \nASHK Sedeque’s senior information offi cer Dr Mohammad Hannan when I was denied \ninformation from the Water Development Board. Back then he said that there should be a \nlaw for professional journalists to get information. \n \nWhen I first met MRDI executive director Hasibur Rahman Mukur at a two-day workshop at \nGramer Kagok on “Election and Political Repor ting” November 2008, I had no idea that the \nMRDI would be a major facilitator in solving a major problem. Eleven days before that on \nOctober 20 the caretaker government published the RTI Ordinance in a gazette. Later the \nelected government modified the ordinance and had it approved at the parliament on March \n29, 2009. I read about the law in the newspaper, but could not yet understand it. \n \nOn July 1 that year, when the law was made effective, I discussed about newspaper articles \non the RTI Act with Mr. Mobin. After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act. Although it was difficult \nfor me to understand from reading that module,  I made some small reports with guidance \nfrom Executive Editor Asad Asaduzzaman. In another workshop in 2010, Mukur of MRDI \ncame and gave me a special award for my reports on the RTI Act. Finally I got further \nopportunity to sharpen my knowledge by attendi ng another two- day training by the MRDI in \nDhaka on January 18 and 19. \n  \nThoughts on the subject \nThere had been a lot of complaints over recruitment of teachers after politicians were \nappointed head of management committee of educational institutions. Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter. He is usually found in the office after the office hours and during that time he \nis usually surrounded by certain teachers. In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports. I also decided to file an information request under the \nRTI Act at the secondary education office. \n \nLegal battle for information \nI went to see the Keshabpur Upazila Secondar y Education officer for three days in February \nthis year with my application but he was not there. As he was not available I went to the DO \nof the office, Office Assistant Ruhul Amin on February 6. As I requested him to take my \napplication, he became busy typing in a computer. After waiting for 10 minutes, I requested \nhim again. He took it, looked at it and put it down. I forwarded another copy asking him to \nsign it as a received copy. He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act. I told him that this letter is on a \nform prescribed by a government gazette.

I returned to Rangamati and \n \n \n38\nprepared an information request application with  my newly acquired knowledge. To check \nmy flaws, I e-mailed my form to MRDI’s responsible officer Farhana Afroze. She corrected a \nfew things. I was hesitant about filing the application as I am a junior and new in journalism. I \nalso saw that the person to whom I woul d file the application had good terms with my \nseniors. This stopped me from filing the application. \n \nSix months later I got another call from my office on January 15, 2012 asking me to join yet \nanother two-day workshop in Dhaka on January 18-19. I attended it and committed to apply \nthe RTI act. \n",
            " to be given by any organization. But one must have a clear \nconcept about the law. I am saying this on the basis of my experience with the DC office \nover brick kiln. I filed my application on March 28, 2012 asking for on what legal and policy \nbasis the brick kilns were allowed to operate in 10 upazila of Rangamati district and its \nassociated details. \n \nDesignated Officer Shafiqul Islam did not want to give most part of the information that I \nwanted. He gave me this message 10 days later. He said that he could tell where these brick \nkilns are—but my asking for other information was tantamount to harassing him. I told him \nthat as per the law, he should give it in writing what information he would not give to me. \nThis made him somewhat angry. He said, because of the good terms with me, he was \noffering me information against my first question—which I was refusing. After saying this, he \ncalled a peon and asked him to bring the RTI Act book. The peon brought in two books. After \nflipping through some pages, his voice became frustrated, “the government makes law just \nlike that. What’s the point of making a law if it is not implemented.” Afterwards I told him that \nif he refused to give me the information, I will file for an appeal. This saddened him. \n \nOn April 23, I finally got my information. the an swer was: there is no brick kiln in Rangamati. \nIf there is any, it is illegal. This answer addresses all other questions. \n \nThrough this experience, I learnt that if you do not have ideas about the act, officials like \nShafiqul Islam will get away denying your rights—although they themselves do not know \nmuch about the law. \n \nIf you did not get your information after y ou applied and sat back, negative attitude \ndoes not help \nAs I have seen, if you wait for things to happen after application, you will not get information. \nAnd if you develop a negative view about the authority in such a situation, it does not help. \nIts because often your application can get buried under other official works. A negative \nattitude will be a mistake. It happened to me. When I did not get information 15 days after I \napplied for the third time at the Zila Parishad, I thought the Information Officer is ignoring me. \nLater I thought of contacting the DO and found out that I was wrong all along. \n \nI had to give extra time after filing an appeal \nI had to remind the Appellate Authority after filing my appeal and the Appellate Authority, \nwhich was the Rangamati Zila Parishad Ch airman, sought one week’s time and had given \nme the information. I could have lodged a complaint with the Information Commission after \nexpiry of my deadline. That would have taken longer time for me to get my information. \n \n \n \n \n \n40\nTransparency, accountability and good governance have to be ensured: \nI, Himel Chakma, am an individual. Applying the RTI Act just by myself is not enough. My \nexperience says that if hundreds of Himels apply this law, then it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance. People want to know many things. This wish to know is \nnot enough if it is confined within their thoughts. I believe the RTI Act is not just for the \njournalists to apply, but for all to exercise in order to make it a tool to ensure good \ngovernance. Otherwise it will remain as a law only. \n \n \n \n \nClose to a legal battle in \nsearch of information \n \nMotahar Hossain, Senior Staff Reporter, Dainik Gramer Kagoj, Jessore \n \nTwenty five years into my journalism career, t he RTI Act gave me the opportunity to sharpen \nmy profession as well as become a teacher. I become a teacher of the RTI Act for people \ncoming to me with various problems. From 2009, the MRDI created the scope for me to \nbecome an apprentice teacher. \n \nOnce I faced many rejections in getting information from different offices due to \ngovernment’s secrecy law or instructions of the higher authorities. I joined Dainik Gramer \nKagoj in 1999 and worked with various strategies and professional instructions given by my \neditor Mobinul Islam Mobin to gather informati on. Once I turned to",
            " late education minister \nASHK Sedeque’s senior information offi cer Dr Mohammad Hannan when I was denied \ninformation from the Water Development Board. Back then he said that there should be a \nlaw for professional journalists to get information. \n \nWhen I first met MRDI executive director Hasibur Rahman Mukur at a two-day workshop at \nGramer Kagok on “Election and Political Repor ting” November 2008, I had no idea that the \nMRDI would be a major facilitator in solving a major problem. Eleven days before that on \nOctober 20 the caretaker government published the RTI Ordinance in a gazette. Later the \nelected government modified the ordinance and had it approved at the parliament on March \n29, 2009. I read about the law in the newspaper, but could not yet understand it. \n \nOn July 1 that year, when the law was made effective, I discussed about newspaper articles \non the RTI Act with Mr. Mobin. After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act. Although it was difficult \nfor me to understand from reading that module,  I made some small reports with guidance \nfrom Executive Editor Asad Asaduzzaman. In another workshop in 2010, Mukur of MRDI \ncame and gave me a special award for my reports on the RTI Act. Finally I got further \nopportunity to sharpen my knowledge by attendi ng another two- day training by the MRDI in \nDhaka on January 18 and 19. \n  \nThoughts on the subject \nThere had been a lot of complaints over recruitment of teachers after politicians were \nappointed head of management committee of educational institutions. Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter. He is usually found in the office after the office hours and during that time he \nis usually surrounded by certain teachers. In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports. I also decided to file an information request under the \nRTI Act at the secondary education office. \n \nLegal battle for information \nI went to see the Keshabpur Upazila Secondar y Education officer for three days in February \nthis year with my application but he was not there. As he was not available I went to the DO \nof the office, Office Assistant Ruhul Amin on February 6. As I requested him to take my \napplication, he became busy typing in a computer. After waiting for 10 minutes, I requested \nhim again. He took it, looked at it and put it down. I forwarded another copy asking him to \nsign it as a received copy. He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act. I told him that this letter is on a \nform prescribed by a government gazette. He gave it back saying, give it to the boss when \nhe returns. \n \nI told him that I came to meet his boss for the last three days. He said he was busy with the \n"

Copy of Whistleblower (protection) Act, 2011 \n \n \n \n3\n \nIntroduction \nThe Right to Information Act, 2009 shines as a milestone in the path of \nBangladesh’s democracy. This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

            ", “okay come back tomorrow. I will see what I can do.” \n \n \n37\n \nI returned to my office feeling down and talked to my editor Mr. Mobin and then he \nsuggested me to talk to Mukur of MRDI. Mukur gave me several suggestions and said, \n“whether you’d take the information or not we will see later. Firstly take the letter asking for \nTk 488,004.” \n \nI returned to magistrate Nahidul Mostak next day. I asked him to give me the letter. But he \ndid not give it to me. He nicely said, “what would you do with the letter. This would cause \nunnecessary problems. It’s better that you take the manual list. It’s not going to cost much.” I \ntried to persuade him to give me the letter, but he did not agree. So I took the photocopy of \nthe manual list for Tk 1300. \n \nBut I utilized an advice of Mukur. I wanted to see the file. In my file I saw the Tk 4.88 lakh \ncost breakdown signed by the magistrate. It said, “Following is the upazila wise cost for \ncollecting through telephone information from DRR and offices.” It adds, Sadar upazila- Tk \n1.60 lakh, Avoynagar Tk 30,000, Bagharpara Tk 50,000, Chowgachha Tk 35,000, \nJhikargachha Tk 35,000, Keshabpur tk 30,000,  Monirampur Tk 70,000, Sharsha Tk 60,000, \ne-service Tk 4X4501= Tk 180,004. Total Tk 488, 004. \n \nAs I looked into the information that I got, I saw what I had suspected from the beginning. All \nthe information services were actually e-services. The list talks about who got which land, \nwhich are the personal land markers etc. This was done either without understanding what \ninformation means in the RTI Act or to get a fake credit to bag some national level award. I \nwanted to run a nice story. But my editor said, forget it. It’s no use making the administration \nunhappy. \n \nI did not stop making good reports using the RTI. In addition I had to teach officials the law. \nWorking with this law is fun. But there are problems too. People who knew me well and \ngreeted me with a smile now pretend they do not know me.

Otherwise it will remain as a law only. \n \n \n \n \nClose to a legal battle in \nsearch of information \n \nMotahar Hossain, Senior Staff Reporter, Dainik Gramer Kagoj, Jessore \n \nTwenty five years into my journalism career, t he RTI Act gave me the opportunity to sharpen \nmy profession as well as become a teacher.

Eleven days before that on \nOctober 20 the caretaker government published the RTI Ordinance in a gazette.

After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act.

Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter.

In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports.

As he was not available I went to the DO \nof the office, Office Assistant Ruhul Amin on February 6. As I requested him to take my \napplication, he became busy typing in a computer. After waiting for 10 minutes, I requested \nhim again. He took it, looked at it and put it down. I forwarded another copy asking him to \nsign it as a received copy. He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act. I told him that this letter is on a \nform prescribed by a government gazette.

Copy of Whistleblower (protection) Act, 2011 \n \n \n \n3\n \nIntroduction \nThe Right to Information Act, 2009 shines as a milestone in the path of \nBangladesh’s democracy. This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

            ", “okay come back tomorrow. I will see what I can do.” \n \n \n37\n \nI returned to my office feeling down and talked to my editor Mr. Mobin and then he \nsuggested me to talk to Mukur of MRDI. Mukur gave me several suggestions and said, \n“whether you’d take the information or not we will see later. Firstly take the letter asking for \nTk 488,004.” \n \nI returned to magistrate Nahidul Mostak next day. I asked him to give me the letter. But he \ndid not give it to me. He nicely said, “what would you do with the letter. This would cause \nunnecessary problems. It’s better that you take the manual list. It’s not going to cost much.” I \ntried to persuade him to give me the letter, but he did not agree. So I took the photocopy of \nthe manual list for Tk 1300. \n \nBut I utilized an advice of Mukur. I wanted to see the file. In my file I saw the Tk 4.88 lakh \ncost breakdown signed by the magistrate. It said, “Following is the upazila wise cost for \ncollecting through telephone information from DRR and offices.” It adds, Sadar upazila- Tk \n1.60 lakh, Avoynagar Tk 30,000, Bagharpara Tk 50,000, Chowgachha Tk 35,000, \nJhikargachha Tk 35,000, Keshabpur tk 30,000,  Monirampur Tk 70,000, Sharsha Tk 60,000, \ne-service Tk 4X4501= Tk 180,004. Total Tk 488, 004. \n \nAs I looked into the information that I got, I saw what I had suspected from the beginning. All \nthe information services were actually e-services. The list talks about who got which land, \nwhich are the personal land markers etc. This was done either without understanding what \ninformation means in the RTI Act or to get a fake credit to bag some national level award. I \nwanted to run a nice story. But my editor said, forget it. It’s no use making the administration \nunhappy. \n \nI did not stop making good reports using the RTI. In addition I had to teach officials the law. \nWorking with this law is fun. But there are problems too. People who knew me well and \ngreeted me with a smile now pretend they do not know me. They do not receive my calls like \nbefore. When they come face to face, they would say with an embarrassed smile- are you \nwell Mr Asad? \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSome will become friends, \nsome rivals if you use the RTI \nIf RTI is used, it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance in the country \n \n \n \nHimel Chakma, Rangamati Correspondent, Dainik Shokaler Khabor \n \nSome will become friends, some rivals if you use the RTI. But if it is widely used, then it \nwould ensure transparency, accountability and good governance in the country. This is my \nrealization after applying the law upon receiving training from the MRDI. \n \nHow I learnt about RTI \nAt 10 pm June 21, 2011, I got a call from the Shokaler Khobor office. It was National Editor \nTarikul Islam. He asked me to attend a two-day workshop in Dhaka. I took part there. There \nwere 22 others from different districts to l earn about the RTI. I returned to Rangamati and \n \n \n38\nprepared an information request application with  my newly acquired knowledge. To check \nmy flaws, I e-mailed my form to MRDI’s responsible officer Farhana Afroze. She corrected a \nfew things. I was hesitant about filing the application as I am a junior and new in journalism. I \nalso saw that the person to whom I woul d file the application had good terms with my \nseniors. This stopped me from filing the application. \n \nSix months later I got another call from my office on January 15, 2012 asking me to join yet \nanother two-day workshop in Dhaka on January 18-19. I attended it and committed to apply \nthe RTI act. \n",
            " to be given by any organization. But one must have a clear \nconcept about the law. I am saying this on the basis of my experience with the DC office \nover brick kiln. I filed my application on March 28, 2012 asking for on what legal and policy \nbasis the brick kilns were allowed to operate in 10 upazila of Rangamati district and its \nassociated details. \n \nDesignated Officer Shafiqul Islam did not want to give most part of the information that I \nwanted. He gave me this message 10 days later. He said that he could tell where these brick \nkilns are—but my asking for other information was tantamount to harassing him. I told him \nthat as per the law, he should give it in writing what information he would not give to me. \nThis made him somewhat angry. He said, because of the good terms with me, he was \noffering me information against my first question—which I was refusing. After saying this, he \ncalled a peon and asked him to bring the RTI Act book. The peon brought in two books. After \nflipping through some pages, his voice became frustrated, “the government makes law just \nlike that. What’s the point of making a law if it is not implemented.” Afterwards I told him that \nif he refused to give me the information, I will file for an appeal. This saddened him. \n \nOn April 23, I finally got my information. the an swer was: there is no brick kiln in Rangamati. \nIf there is any, it is illegal. This answer addresses all other questions. \n \nThrough this experience, I learnt that if you do not have ideas about the act, officials like \nShafiqul Islam will get away denying your rights—although they themselves do not know \nmuch about the law. \n \nIf you did not get your information after y ou applied and sat back, negative attitude \ndoes not help \nAs I have seen, if you wait for things to happen after application, you will not get information. \nAnd if you develop a negative view about the authority in such a situation, it does not help. \nIts because often your application can get buried under other official works. A negative \nattitude will be a mistake. It happened to me. When I did not get information 15 days after I \napplied for the third time at the Zila Parishad, I thought the Information Officer is ignoring me. \nLater I thought of contacting the DO and found out that I was wrong all along. \n \nI had to give extra time after filing an appeal \nI had to remind the Appellate Authority after filing my appeal and the Appellate Authority, \nwhich was the Rangamati Zila Parishad Ch airman, sought one week’s time and had given \nme the information. I could have lodged a complaint with the Information Commission after \nexpiry of my deadline. That would have taken longer time for me to get my information. \n \n \n \n \n \n40\nTransparency, accountability and good governance have to be ensured: \nI, Himel Chakma, am an individual. Applying the RTI Act just by myself is not enough. My \nexperience says that if hundreds of Himels apply this law, then it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance. People want to know many things. This wish to know is \nnot enough if it is confined within their thoughts. I believe the RTI Act is not just for the \njournalists to apply, but for all to exercise in order to make it a tool to ensure good \ngovernance. Otherwise it will remain as a law only. \n \n \n \n \nClose to a legal battle in \nsearch of information \n \nMotahar Hossain, Senior Staff Reporter, Dainik Gramer Kagoj, Jessore \n \nTwenty five years into my journalism career, t he RTI Act gave me the opportunity to sharpen \nmy profession as well as become a teacher.

Copy of Whistleblower (protection) Act, 2011 \n \n \n \n3\n \nIntroduction \nThe Right to Information Act, 2009 shines as a milestone in the path of \nBangladesh’s democracy. This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

A staff named Hazrat Ali put a circular seal \non the signature and advised me to contact their boss. \n \nBut I could not find the boss for the next 10 days. Then I learnt from that office that my \napplication has been given to the boss in a file. The information that I sought is available \nonly with their boss, they said. As the boss did not receive calls from my cell phone, I finally \ngot him using another mobile phone and told him about my application. After 18 working \ndays, I met him near the Social Welfare office at Upazila Parishad building. I reminded \nShekh Firoze Ahmed about the obligation as per Article 9 of the RTI Act to provide me with \nthe information within 20 working days. He casually said, okay, okay and left the place \nquickly. \n \nAs I did not get any information, I filed an appeal on March 28 at the Jessore Secondary \nEducation Office. The district education officer received the appeal sincerely and instantly \ngave the application to his office assistant asking him to send it to Keshabpur Upazila \nSecondary Education Office so that they provide the information. By then I learnt that Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed has been given a stand release. A new official has replaced him and when I \ncontacted him he said his office received no such letter. It compelled me to lodge a \ncomplaint on April 25 to the Information Commission. \n \nAftermath \nThree years after the enactment of the RTI Act only a handful journalists have developed \nsome primary idea about it. To use it efficiently , a professional journalist must know the law \nbetter. It is possible for a journalist to get the maximum information using it. The law has not \nyet gained recognition among general people. The government needs to widely publicise \nabout it and make the information providing officials aware of it. \n \n \n42\n \nBut you’re bound to give \nthe information \n \nMonirul Islam, District Correspondent, Prothom Alo, Jessore \n \n“Cannot give you photocopies of government lett ers, if you want you can see them.” These \nwere the typical let downs for me till two years back at different government offices. \n \nAfter the RTI Act 2009, officials tell me to apply in accordance with the law. Then after \napplying, that official with little knowledge on the law start to act weird. This is creating bitter \nexperience for journalists. \n \nIn December 2011, MRDI Executive Director Hasibur Rahman Mukur contacted me over the \nphone informing me about a two-day training on RTI to be held in Dhaka on January 18 and \n19 and that Prothom Alo had nominated me. This two-day training opened up a new horizon \nof experience for me. \n \nI got some detailed ideas about the RTI Act at the training. I also fixed a subject for \ninvestigation at the training using the act. \n \nWith help from MRDI’s Manager, Programme and Communication Farhana Afroz, I applied \nto the relevant DO to get some information on the Jessore 250-bed General Hospital. My \nbitter experience begins right from the day I went to the hospital to submit my application. \n \nIt was February 8. To submit my application, I s ent my visiting card to the personal assistant \nof Dr Salah Uddin Ahmed, superintendent in charge of the hospital. After a while, I was told \nto come later as the superintendent was busy. \n \nNobody could tell me who is the DO of the hospital. Later I submitted the application to the \nadministrative officer Abdul Hamid. \n \nI sought five information as the followings: A. list of doctors absent for more than three \nmonths and reasons for their absence. B. List of non-functional equipment in operation \ntheatre, pediatric ward and X-Ray department and names of concerned technicians. C. \nphotocopy of the latest report sent to the higher authorities to repair these equipment. D. list \nof excess staffs employed by the hospital’s own management and the government approved \norganogram. E. Latest written information on opening the coronary care unit. \n \nTwenty days passed without any response from the hospital. On March 22, I filed an appeal \nto Khulna Divisional Director (Health) AKM Ab dus Samad Miah. On",
            " late education minister \nASHK Sedeque’s senior information offi cer Dr Mohammad Hannan when I was denied \ninformation from the Water Development Board. Back then he said that there should be a \nlaw for professional journalists to get information. \n \nWhen I first met MRDI executive director Hasibur Rahman Mukur at a two-day workshop at \nGramer Kagok on “Election and Political Repor ting” November 2008, I had no idea that the \nMRDI would be a major facilitator in solving a major problem. Eleven days before that on \nOctober 20 the caretaker government published the RTI Ordinance in a gazette. Later the \nelected government modified the ordinance and had it approved at the parliament on March \n29, 2009. I read about the law in the newspaper, but could not yet understand it. \n \nOn July 1 that year, when the law was made effective, I discussed about newspaper articles \non the RTI Act with Mr. Mobin. After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act. Although it was difficult \nfor me to understand from reading that module,  I made some small reports with guidance \nfrom Executive Editor Asad Asaduzzaman. In another workshop in 2010, Mukur of MRDI \ncame and gave me a special award for my reports on the RTI Act. Finally I got further \nopportunity to sharpen my knowledge by attendi ng another two- day training by the MRDI in \nDhaka on January 18 and 19. \n  \nThoughts on the subject \nThere had been a lot of complaints over recruitment of teachers after politicians were \nappointed head of management committee of educational institutions. Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter. He is usually found in the office after the office hours and during that time he \nis usually surrounded by certain teachers. In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports. I also decided to file an information request under the \nRTI Act at the secondary education office. \n \nLegal battle for information \nI went to see the Keshabpur Upazila Secondar y Education officer for three days in February \nthis year with my application but he was not there. As he was not available I went to the DO \nof the office, Office Assistant Ruhul Amin on February 6. As I requested him to take my \napplication, he became busy typing in a computer. After waiting for 10 minutes, I requested \nhim again. He took it, looked at it and put it down. I forwarded another copy asking him to \nsign it as a received copy. He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act. I told him that this letter is on a \nform prescribed by a government gazette. He gave it back saying, give it to the boss when \nhe returns. \n \nI told him that I came to meet his boss for the last three days. He said he was busy with the \n",
            " the town from erosion. A lot of money was allocated \nfor the job. But many questioned the effectiveness of the pilot dredging, how much was \ndredged, who drew the allocated money and how and on what policy decisions acted behind \nthe pilot capital dredging project. \n \nOn the other hand, there were lots of complaints of corruption and nepotism against a newly \njoined executive engineer of Roads and Highways Department KM Nur-e-Alam Babul. \n \nI was interested to learn about both the cases. \n \nMy introduction to the RTI Act    \nI participated in a MRDI training on the RTI Act when I was working for The Daily Star. I \njoined the Independent later. Luckily Mukur of MRDI did not forget me. \n \nIn the next installment, Mukur talked to the chief reporter of The Independent Mir Mostafizur \nRahman and I was selected further training. There I learnt how to file an information request, \nappeal or a complaint at the Information Commission. \n \nProfessional duties compel me to remain involved with current events most of the times and \nI could naturally access most information. But I always thought I would never get certain \ninformation as the country was not free of corruption and officials and politicians were not \ncompletely transparent. This is why I turned to apply for information on the two subjects. I \nwanted to be sure whether the RTI Act could really be effective. \n \nMy experience \nFebruary 13, 2012. First I went to the Roads and Highways office and found that the \nexecutive engineer had gone to a site. I enquired who was the DO in the office to whom I \ncould submit my application. This surprised everyone in the office. What is that and why? I \nrealized they were unaware of the law. So I talked about it and the purpose of my \napplication. They suggested me to talk to the executive engineer. \n \nI called up the executive engineer over the cell phone. It seemed that upon receiving my call, \nhe felt troubled. He told me that he received no such instructions from the higher authorities. \nThere was no DO and he was never asked to appoint a DO. \n \n \n \n45\nI told him about my application and he wryly said leave the application at the reception. He \nwould look at it. \n \nI left the application at the reception and had my copy received and left for the Water \nDevelopment Board office in Ranigram area of the town. I was glad to learn that there was a \nDO in this office. But the trouble started when I submitted my application. \n \nThe DO of this office was Deputy Assistant Engineer Anwar Sadat. When I went to him to \nsubmit the application, he sought my forgiveness and literally tried to run away from the \noffice. He said he can not do anything without discussing the matter with the executive \nengineer. He can not even receive the application. \n \nI called up the executive engineer and tried to convince him that there was no harm in \nreceiving my application. He is free to give me the information or deny it. At one point, he \ninstructed his subordinate over the mobile phone to take my application. \n \nAs expected I did not get any feedback from the two offices as the deadline expired. On \nMarch 28,  I filed two separate appeals to the executive engineers of the two offices. In \nresponse, on April 3, I received a letter from  executive engineer of roads and highways KM \nNur-e-Alam Babul asking me to collect my information from the Deputy Assistant Engineer at \nhis office. \n \nBefore going there, I called up the relevant official and he gave me an appointment. But \nwhen I went there, he did not turn up or receive my phone calls. Then I got him through the \nmobile phone of another official. This compelled him to come to the office and gave me a \nfantastic excuse for his delay. \n \nWhen I asked him to give me the information,  he offered me tea and cigarette. He started \nsaying that he did not have the information and he was not capable of giving it all. He \npromised me that he would gather them all and send it via a peon.  \n \nBut till date (May 14), he did not send me anything. The Water Development Board also did \nnot give me explanation. \n \nOn May 2, I lodged a complaint with the Information Commission. \n \nFrustration and Expectation \nAs a journalist I did not get timely information using the RTI"

A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

            ", “okay come back tomorrow. I will see what I can do.” \n \n \n37\n \nI returned to my office feeling down and talked to my editor Mr. Mobin and then he \nsuggested me to talk to Mukur of MRDI. Mukur gave me several suggestions and said, \n“whether you’d take the information or not we will see later. Firstly take the letter asking for \nTk 488,004.” \n \nI returned to magistrate Nahidul Mostak next day. I asked him to give me the letter. But he \ndid not give it to me. He nicely said, “what would you do with the letter. This would cause \nunnecessary problems. It’s better that you take the manual list. It’s not going to cost much.” I \ntried to persuade him to give me the letter, but he did not agree. So I took the photocopy of \nthe manual list for Tk 1300. \n \nBut I utilized an advice of Mukur. I wanted to see the file. In my file I saw the Tk 4.88 lakh \ncost breakdown signed by the magistrate. It said, “Following is the upazila wise cost for \ncollecting through telephone information from DRR and offices.” It adds, Sadar upazila- Tk \n1.60 lakh, Avoynagar Tk 30,000, Bagharpara Tk 50,000, Chowgachha Tk 35,000, \nJhikargachha Tk 35,000, Keshabpur tk 30,000,  Monirampur Tk 70,000, Sharsha Tk 60,000, \ne-service Tk 4X4501= Tk 180,004. Total Tk 488, 004. \n \nAs I looked into the information that I got, I saw what I had suspected from the beginning. All \nthe information services were actually e-services. The list talks about who got which land, \nwhich are the personal land markers etc. This was done either without understanding what \ninformation means in the RTI Act or to get a fake credit to bag some national level award. I \nwanted to run a nice story. But my editor said, forget it. It’s no use making the administration \nunhappy. \n \nI did not stop making good reports using the RTI. In addition I had to teach officials the law. \nWorking with this law is fun. But there are problems too. People who knew me well and \ngreeted me with a smile now pretend they do not know me. They do not receive my calls like \nbefore. When they come face to face, they would say with an embarrassed smile- are you \nwell Mr Asad? \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSome will become friends, \nsome rivals if you use the RTI \nIf RTI is used, it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance in the country \n \n \n \nHimel Chakma, Rangamati Correspondent, Dainik Shokaler Khabor \n \nSome will become friends, some rivals if you use the RTI. But if it is widely used, then it \nwould ensure transparency, accountability and good governance in the country. This is my \nrealization after applying the law upon receiving training from the MRDI. \n \nHow I learnt about RTI \nAt 10 pm June 21, 2011, I got a call from the Shokaler Khobor office. It was National Editor \nTarikul Islam. He asked me to attend a two-day workshop in Dhaka. I took part there. There \nwere 22 others from different districts to l earn about the RTI. I returned to Rangamati and \n \n \n38\nprepared an information request application with  my newly acquired knowledge. To check \nmy flaws, I e-mailed my form to MRDI’s responsible officer Farhana Afroze. She corrected a \nfew things. I was hesitant about filing the application as I am a junior and new in journalism. I \nalso saw that the person to whom I woul d file the application had good terms with my \nseniors. This stopped me from filing the application. \n \nSix months later I got another call from my office on January 15, 2012 asking me to join yet \nanother two-day workshop in Dhaka on January 18-19. I attended it and committed to apply \nthe RTI act. \n",
            " to be given by any organization. But one must have a clear \nconcept about the law. I am saying this on the basis of my experience with the DC office \nover brick kiln. I filed my application on March 28, 2012 asking for on what legal and policy \nbasis the brick kilns were allowed to operate in 10 upazila of Rangamati district and its \nassociated details. \n \nDesignated Officer Shafiqul Islam did not want to give most part of the information that I \nwanted. He gave me this message 10 days later. He said that he could tell where these brick \nkilns are—but my asking for other information was tantamount to harassing him. I told him \nthat as per the law, he should give it in writing what information he would not give to me. \nThis made him somewhat angry. He said, because of the good terms with me, he was \noffering me information against my first question—which I was refusing. After saying this, he \ncalled a peon and asked him to bring the RTI Act book. The peon brought in two books. After \nflipping through some pages, his voice became frustrated, “the government makes law just \nlike that. What’s the point of making a law if it is not implemented.” Afterwards I told him that \nif he refused to give me the information, I will file for an appeal. This saddened him. \n \nOn April 23, I finally got my information. the an swer was: there is no brick kiln in Rangamati. \nIf there is any, it is illegal. This answer addresses all other questions. \n \nThrough this experience, I learnt that if you do not have ideas about the act, officials like \nShafiqul Islam will get away denying your rights—although they themselves do not know \nmuch about the law. \n \nIf you did not get your information after y ou applied and sat back, negative attitude \ndoes not help \nAs I have seen, if you wait for things to happen after application, you will not get information. \nAnd if you develop a negative view about the authority in such a situation, it does not help. \nIts because often your application can get buried under other official works. A negative \nattitude will be a mistake. It happened to me. When I did not get information 15 days after I \napplied for the third time at the Zila Parishad, I thought the Information Officer is ignoring me. \nLater I thought of contacting the DO and found out that I was wrong all along. \n \nI had to give extra time after filing an appeal \nI had to remind the Appellate Authority after filing my appeal and the Appellate Authority, \nwhich was the Rangamati Zila Parishad Ch airman, sought one week’s time and had given \nme the information. I could have lodged a complaint with the Information Commission after \nexpiry of my deadline. That would have taken longer time for me to get my information. \n \n \n \n \n \n40\nTransparency, accountability and good governance have to be ensured: \nI, Himel Chakma, am an individual. Applying the RTI Act just by myself is not enough. My \nexperience says that if hundreds of Himels apply this law, then it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance. People want to know many things. This wish to know is \nnot enough if it is confined within their thoughts. I believe the RTI Act is not just for the \njournalists to apply, but for all to exercise in order to make it a tool to ensure good \ngovernance. Otherwise it will remain as a law only. \n \n \n \n \nClose to a legal battle in \nsearch of information \n \nMotahar Hossain, Senior Staff Reporter, Dainik Gramer Kagoj, Jessore \n \nTwenty five years into my journalism career, t he RTI Act gave me the opportunity to sharpen \nmy profession as well as become a teacher. I become a teacher of the RTI Act for people \ncoming to me with various problems. From 2009, the MRDI created the scope for me to \nbecome an apprentice teacher. \n \nOnce I faced many rejections in getting information from different offices due to \ngovernment’s secrecy law or instructions of the higher authorities. I joined Dainik Gramer \nKagoj in 1999 and worked with various strategies and professional instructions given by my \neditor Mobinul Islam Mobin to gather informati on. Once I turned to",
            " late education minister \nASHK Sedeque’s senior information offi cer Dr Mohammad Hannan when I was denied \ninformation from the Water Development Board. Back then he said that there should be a \nlaw for professional journalists to get information. \n \nWhen I first met MRDI executive director Hasibur Rahman Mukur at a two-day workshop at \nGramer Kagok on “Election and Political Repor ting” November 2008, I had no idea that the \nMRDI would be a major facilitator in solving a major problem. Eleven days before that on \nOctober 20 the caretaker government published the RTI Ordinance in a gazette. Later the \nelected government modified the ordinance and had it approved at the parliament on March \n29, 2009. I read about the law in the newspaper, but could not yet understand it. \n \nOn July 1 that year, when the law was made effective, I discussed about newspaper articles \non the RTI Act with Mr. Mobin. After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act. Although it was difficult \nfor me to understand from reading that module,  I made some small reports with guidance \nfrom Executive Editor Asad Asaduzzaman. In another workshop in 2010, Mukur of MRDI \ncame and gave me a special award for my reports on the RTI Act. Finally I got further \nopportunity to sharpen my knowledge by attendi ng another two- day training by the MRDI in \nDhaka on January 18 and 19. \n  \nThoughts on the subject \nThere had been a lot of complaints over recruitment of teachers after politicians were \nappointed head of management committee of educational institutions. Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter. He is usually found in the office after the office hours and during that time he \nis usually surrounded by certain teachers. In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports. I also decided to file an information request under the \nRTI Act at the secondary education office. \n \nLegal battle for information \nI went to see the Keshabpur Upazila Secondar y Education officer for three days in February \nthis year with my application but he was not there. As he was not available I went to the DO \nof the office, Office Assistant Ruhul Amin on February 6. As I requested him to take my \napplication, he became busy typing in a computer. After waiting for 10 minutes, I requested \nhim again. He took it, looked at it and put it down. I forwarded another copy asking him to \nsign it as a received copy. He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act. I told him that this letter is on a \nform prescribed by a government gazette. He gave it back saying, give it to the boss when \nhe returns. \n \nI told him that I came to meet his boss for the last three days. He said he was busy with the \n"

Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter. He is usually found in the office after the office hours and during that time he \nis usually surrounded by certain teachers. In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports. I also decided to file an information request under the \nRTI Act at the secondary education office. \n \nLegal battle for information \nI went to see the Keshabpur Upazila Secondar y Education officer for three days in February \nthis year with my application but he was not there. As he was not available I went to the DO \nof the office, Office Assistant Ruhul Amin on February 6. As I requested him to take my \napplication, he became busy typing in a computer. After waiting for 10 minutes, I requested \nhim again. He took it, looked at it and put it down. I forwarded another copy asking him to \nsign it as a received copy. He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act. I told him that this letter is on a \nform prescribed by a government gazette. He gave it back saying, give it to the boss when \nhe returns. \n \nI told him that I came to meet his boss for the last three days. He said he was busy with the \n",
            " the town from erosion. A lot of money was allocated \nfor the job. But many questioned the effectiveness of the pilot dredging, how much was \ndredged, who drew the allocated money and how and on what policy decisions acted behind \nthe pilot capital dredging project. \n \nOn the other hand, there were lots of complaints of corruption and nepotism against a newly \njoined executive engineer of Roads and Highways Department KM Nur-e-Alam Babul. \n \nI was interested to learn about both the cases. \n \nMy introduction to the RTI Act    \nI participated in a MRDI training on the RTI Act when I was working for The Daily Star. I \njoined the Independent later. Luckily Mukur of MRDI did not forget me. \n \nIn the next installment, Mukur talked to the chief reporter of The Independent Mir Mostafizur \nRahman and I was selected further training. There I learnt how to file an information request, \nappeal or a complaint at the Information Commission. \n \nProfessional duties compel me to remain involved with current events most of the times and \nI could naturally access most information. But I always thought I would never get certain \ninformation as the country was not free of corruption and officials and politicians were not \ncompletely transparent. This is why I turned to apply for information on the two subjects. I \nwanted to be sure whether the RTI Act could really be effective. \n \nMy experience \nFebruary 13, 2012. First I went to the Roads and Highways office and found that the \nexecutive engineer had gone to a site. I enquired who was the DO in the office to whom I \ncould submit my application. This surprised everyone in the office. What is that and why? I \nrealized they were unaware of the law. So I talked about it and the purpose of my \napplication. They suggested me to talk to the executive engineer. \n \nI called up the executive engineer over the cell phone. It seemed that upon receiving my call, \nhe felt troubled. He told me that he received no such instructions from the higher authorities. \nThere was no DO and he was never asked to appoint a DO. \n \n \n \n45\nI told him about my application and he wryly said leave the application at the reception. He \nwould look at it. \n \nI left the application at the reception and had my copy received and left for the Water \nDevelopment Board office in Ranigram area of the town. I was glad to learn that there was a \nDO in this office. But the trouble started when I submitted my application. \n \nThe DO of this office was Deputy Assistant Engineer Anwar Sadat. When I went to him to \nsubmit the application, he sought my forgiveness and literally tried to run away from the \noffice. He said he can not do anything without discussing the matter with the executive \nengineer. He can not even receive the application. \n \nI called up the executive engineer and tried to convince him that there was no harm in \nreceiving my application. He is free to give me the information or deny it. At one point, he \ninstructed his subordinate over the mobile phone to take my application. \n \nAs expected I did not get any feedback from the two offices as the deadline expired. On \nMarch 28,  I filed two separate appeals to the executive engineers of the two offices. In \nresponse, on April 3, I received a letter from  executive engineer of roads and highways KM \nNur-e-Alam Babul asking me to collect my information from the Deputy Assistant Engineer at \nhis office. \n \nBefore going there, I called up the relevant official and he gave me an appointment. But \nwhen I went there, he did not turn up or receive my phone calls. Then I got him through the \nmobile phone of another official. This compelled him to come to the office and gave me a \nfantastic excuse for his delay. \n \nWhen I asked him to give me the information,  he offered me tea and cigarette. He started \nsaying that he did not have the information and he was not capable of giving it all. He \npromised me that he would gather them all and send it via a peon.  \n \nBut till date (May 14), he did not send me anything. The Water Development Board also did \nnot give me explanation. \n \nOn May 2, I lodged a complaint with the Information Commission. \n \nFrustration and Expectation \nAs a journalist I did not get timely information using the RTI"

As the boss did not receive calls from my cell phone, I finally \ngot him using another mobile phone and told him about my application. After 18 working \ndays, I met him near the Social Welfare office at Upazila Parishad building.

The district education officer received the appeal sincerely and instantly \ngave the application to his office assistant asking him to send it to Keshabpur Upazila \nSecondary Education Office so that they provide the information. By then I learnt that Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed has been given a stand release. A new official has replaced him and when I \ncontacted him he said his office received no such letter. It compelled me to lodge a \ncomplaint on April 25 to the Information Commission. \n \nAftermath \nThree years after the enactment of the RTI Act only a handful journalists have developed \nsome primary idea about it. To use it efficiently , a professional journalist must know the law \nbetter. It is possible for a journalist to get the maximum information using it.

Then after \napplying, that official with little knowledge on the law start to act weird. This is creating bitter \nexperience for journalists. \n \nIn December 2011, MRDI Executive Director Hasibur Rahman Mukur contacted me over the \nphone informing me about a two-day training on RTI to be held in Dhaka on January 18 and \n19 and that Prothom Alo had nominated me. This two-day training opened up a new horizon \nof experience for me. \n \nI got some detailed ideas about the RTI Act at the training. I also fixed a subject for \ninvestigation at the training using the act. \n \nWith help from MRDI’s Manager, Programme and Communication Farhana Afroz, I applied \nto the relevant DO to get some information on the Jessore 250-bed General Hospital. My \nbitter experience begins right from the day I went to the hospital to submit my application. \n \nIt was February 8. To submit my application, I s ent my visiting card to the personal assistant \nof Dr Salah Uddin Ahmed, superintendent in charge of the hospital. After a while, I was told \nto come later as the superintendent was busy. \n \nNobody could tell me who is the DO of the hospital. Later I submitted the application to the \nadministrative officer Abdul Hamid. \n \nI sought five information as the followings: A. list of doctors absent for more than three \nmonths and reasons for their absence. B. List of non-functional equipment in operation \ntheatre, pediatric ward and X-Ray department and names of concerned technicians. C. \nphotocopy of the latest report sent to the higher authorities to repair these equipment. D. list \nof excess staffs employed by the hospital’s own management and the government approved \norganogram. E.

After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act.

Back then he said that there should be a \nlaw for professional journalists to get information. \n \nWhen I first met MRDI executive director Hasibur Rahman Mukur at a two-day workshop at \nGramer Kagok on “Election and Political Repor ting” November 2008, I had no idea that the \nMRDI would be a major facilitator in solving a major problem. Eleven days before that on \nOctober 20 the caretaker government published the RTI Ordinance in a gazette.

I read about the law in the newspaper, but could not yet understand it. \n \nOn July 1 that year, when the law was made effective, I discussed about newspaper articles \non the RTI Act with Mr. Mobin. After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act.

Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter. He is usually found in the office after the office hours and during that time he \nis usually surrounded by certain teachers. In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports. I also decided to file an information request under the \nRTI Act at the secondary education office. \n \nLegal battle for information \nI went to see the Keshabpur Upazila Secondar y Education officer for three days in February \nthis year with my application but he was not there.

After waiting for 10 minutes, I requested \nhim again. He took it, looked at it and put it down. I forwarded another copy asking him to \nsign it as a received copy. He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act.

Copy of Whistleblower (protection) Act, 2011 \n \n \n \n3\n \nIntroduction \nThe Right to Information Act, 2009 shines as a milestone in the path of \nBangladesh’s democracy. This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

A staff named Hazrat Ali put a circular seal \non the signature and advised me to contact their boss. \n \nBut I could not find the boss for the next 10 days. Then I learnt from that office that my \napplication has been given to the boss in a file. The information that I sought is available \nonly with their boss, they said. As the boss did not receive calls from my cell phone, I finally \ngot him using another mobile phone and told him about my application. After 18 working \ndays, I met him near the Social Welfare office at Upazila Parishad building. I reminded \nShekh Firoze Ahmed about the obligation as per Article 9 of the RTI Act to provide me with \nthe information within 20 working days. He casually said, okay, okay and left the place \nquickly. \n \nAs I did not get any information, I filed an appeal on March 28 at the Jessore Secondary \nEducation Office. The district education officer received the appeal sincerely and instantly \ngave the application to his office assistant asking him to send it to Keshabpur Upazila \nSecondary Education Office so that they provide the information. By then I learnt that Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed has been given a stand release. A new official has replaced him and when I \ncontacted him he said his office received no such letter. It compelled me to lodge a \ncomplaint on April 25 to the Information Commission. \n \nAftermath \nThree years after the enactment of the RTI Act only a handful journalists have developed \nsome primary idea about it. To use it efficiently , a professional journalist must know the law \nbetter. It is possible for a journalist to get the maximum information using it. The law has not \nyet gained recognition among general people. The government needs to widely publicise \nabout it and make the information providing officials aware of it. \n \n \n42\n \nBut you’re bound to give \nthe information \n \nMonirul Islam, District Correspondent, Prothom Alo, Jessore \n \n“Cannot give you photocopies of government lett ers, if you want you can see them.” These \nwere the typical let downs for me till two years back at different government offices. \n \nAfter the RTI Act 2009, officials tell me to apply in accordance with the law. Then after \napplying, that official with little knowledge on the law start to act weird. This is creating bitter \nexperience for journalists. \n \nIn December 2011, MRDI Executive Director Hasibur Rahman Mukur contacted me over the \nphone informing me about a two-day training on RTI to be held in Dhaka on January 18 and \n19 and that Prothom Alo had nominated me. This two-day training opened up a new horizon \nof experience for me. \n \nI got some detailed ideas about the RTI Act at the training. I also fixed a subject for \ninvestigation at the training using the act. \n \nWith help from MRDI’s Manager, Programme and Communication Farhana Afroz, I applied \nto the relevant DO to get some information on the Jessore 250-bed General Hospital. My \nbitter experience begins right from the day I went to the hospital to submit my application. \n \nIt was February 8. To submit my application, I s ent my visiting card to the personal assistant \nof Dr Salah Uddin Ahmed, superintendent in charge of the hospital. After a while, I was told \nto come later as the superintendent was busy. \n \nNobody could tell me who is the DO of the hospital. Later I submitted the application to the \nadministrative officer Abdul Hamid. \n \nI sought five information as the followings: A. list of doctors absent for more than three \nmonths and reasons for their absence. B. List of non-functional equipment in operation \ntheatre, pediatric ward and X-Ray department and names of concerned technicians. C. \nphotocopy of the latest report sent to the higher authorities to repair these equipment. D. list \nof excess staffs employed by the hospital’s own management and the government approved \norganogram. E. Latest written information on opening the coronary care unit. \n \nTwenty days passed without any response from the hospital. On March 22, I filed an appeal \nto Khulna Divisional Director (Health) AKM Ab dus Samad Miah. On",
            " late education minister \nASHK Sedeque’s senior information offi cer Dr Mohammad Hannan when I was denied \ninformation from the Water Development Board. Back then he said that there should be a \nlaw for professional journalists to get information. \n \nWhen I first met MRDI executive director Hasibur Rahman Mukur at a two-day workshop at \nGramer Kagok on “Election and Political Repor ting” November 2008, I had no idea that the \nMRDI would be a major facilitator in solving a major problem. Eleven days before that on \nOctober 20 the caretaker government published the RTI Ordinance in a gazette. Later the \nelected government modified the ordinance and had it approved at the parliament on March \n29, 2009. I read about the law in the newspaper, but could not yet understand it. \n \nOn July 1 that year, when the law was made effective, I discussed about newspaper articles \non the RTI Act with Mr. Mobin. After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act. Although it was difficult \nfor me to understand from reading that module,  I made some small reports with guidance \nfrom Executive Editor Asad Asaduzzaman. In another workshop in 2010, Mukur of MRDI \ncame and gave me a special award for my reports on the RTI Act. Finally I got further \nopportunity to sharpen my knowledge by attendi ng another two- day training by the MRDI in \nDhaka on January 18 and 19. \n  \nThoughts on the subject \nThere had been a lot of complaints over recruitment of teachers after politicians were \nappointed head of management committee of educational institutions. Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter. He is usually found in the office after the office hours and during that time he \nis usually surrounded by certain teachers. In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports. I also decided to file an information request under the \nRTI Act at the secondary education office. \n \nLegal battle for information \nI went to see the Keshabpur Upazila Secondar y Education officer for three days in February \nthis year with my application but he was not there. As he was not available I went to the DO \nof the office, Office Assistant Ruhul Amin on February 6. As I requested him to take my \napplication, he became busy typing in a computer. After waiting for 10 minutes, I requested \nhim again. He took it, looked at it and put it down. I forwarded another copy asking him to \nsign it as a received copy. He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act. I told him that this letter is on a \nform prescribed by a government gazette. He gave it back saying, give it to the boss when \nhe returns. \n \nI told him that I came to meet his boss for the last three days. He said he was busy with the \n",

But many questioned the effectiveness of the pilot dredging, how much was \ndredged, who drew the allocated money and how and on what policy decisions acted behind \nthe pilot capital dredging project. \n \nOn the other hand, there were lots of complaints of corruption and nepotism against a newly \njoined executive engineer of Roads and Highways Department KM Nur-e-Alam Babul. \n \nI was interested to learn about both the cases. \n \nMy introduction to the RTI Act    \nI participated in a MRDI training on the RTI Act when I was working for The Daily Star. I \njoined the Independent later. Luckily Mukur of MRDI did not forget me. \n \nIn the next installment, Mukur talked to the chief reporter of The Independent Mir Mostafizur \nRahman and I was selected further training. There I learnt how to file an information request, \nappeal or a complaint at the Information Commission. \n \nProfessional duties compel me to remain involved with current events most of the times and \nI could naturally access most information. But I always thought I would never get certain \ninformation as the country was not free of corruption and officials and politicians were not \ncompletely transparent. This is why I turned to apply for information on the two subjects. I \nwanted to be sure whether the RTI Act could really be effective. \n \nMy experience \nFebruary 13, 2012. First I went to the Roads and Highways office and found that the \nexecutive engineer had gone to a site. I enquired who was the DO in the office to whom I \ncould submit my application. This surprised everyone in the office. What is that and why? I \nrealized they were unaware of the law. So I talked about it and the purpose of my \napplication. They suggested me to talk to the executive engineer. \n \nI called up the executive engineer over the cell phone. It seemed that upon receiving my call, \nhe felt troubled. He told me that he received no such instructions from the higher authorities. \nThere was no DO and he was never asked to appoint a DO. \n \n \n \n45\nI told him about my application and he wryly said leave the application at the reception. He \nwould look at it. \n \nI left the application at the reception and had my copy received and left for the Water \nDevelopment Board office in Ranigram area of the town. I was glad to learn that there was a \nDO in this office. But the trouble started when I submitted my application. \n \nThe DO of this office was Deputy Assistant Engineer Anwar Sadat. When I went to him to \nsubmit the application, he sought my forgiveness and literally tried to run away from the \noffice. He said he can not do anything without discussing the matter with the executive \nengineer. He can not even receive the application. \n \nI called up the executive engineer and tried to convince him that there was no harm in \nreceiving my application. He is free to give me the information or deny it. At one point, he \ninstructed his subordinate over the mobile phone to take my application. \n \nAs expected I did not get any feedback from the two offices as the deadline expired. On \nMarch 28,  I filed two separate appeals to the executive engineers of the two offices. In \nresponse, on April 3, I received a letter from  executive engineer of roads and highways KM \nNur-e-Alam Babul asking me to collect my information from the Deputy Assistant Engineer at \nhis office. \n \nBefore going there, I called up the relevant official and he gave me an appointment. But \nwhen I went there, he did not turn up or receive my phone calls. Then I got him through the \nmobile phone of another official. This compelled him to come to the office and gave me a \nfantastic excuse for his delay. \n \nWhen I asked him to give me the information,  he offered me tea and cigarette. He started \nsaying that he did not have the information and he was not capable of giving it all. He \npromised me that he would gather them all and send it via a peon.  \n \nBut till date (May 14), he did not send me anything. The Water Development Board also did \nnot give me explanation. \n \nOn May 2, I lodged a complaint with the Information Commission. \n \nFrustration and Expectation \nAs a journalist I did not get timely information using the RTI"

I will see what I can do.” \n \n \n37\n \nI returned to my office feeling down and talked to my editor Mr. Mobin and then he \nsuggested me to talk to Mukur of MRDI. Mukur gave me several suggestions and said, \n“whether you’d take the information or not we will see later. Firstly take the letter asking for \nTk 488,004.” \n \nI returned to magistrate Nahidul Mostak next day. I asked him to give me the letter. But he \ndid not give it to me. He nicely said, “what would you do with the letter. This would cause \nunnecessary problems. It’s better that you take the manual list. It’s not going to cost much.” I \ntried to persuade him to give me the letter, but he did not agree. So I took the photocopy of \nthe manual list for Tk 1300. \n \nBut I utilized an advice of Mukur. I wanted to see the file. In my file I saw the Tk 4.88 lakh \ncost breakdown signed by the magistrate. It said, “Following is the upazila wise cost for \ncollecting through telephone information from DRR and offices.” It adds, Sadar upazila- Tk \n1.60 lakh, Avoynagar Tk 30,000, Bagharpara Tk 50,000, Chowgachha Tk 35,000, \nJhikargachha Tk 35,000, Keshabpur tk 30,000,  Monirampur Tk 70,000, Sharsha Tk 60,000, \ne-service Tk 4X4501= Tk 180,004. Total Tk 488, 004. \n \nAs I looked into the information that I got, I saw what I had suspected from the beginning. All \nthe information services were actually e-services. The list talks about who got which land, \nwhich are the personal land markers etc. This was done either without understanding what \ninformation means in the RTI Act or to get a fake credit to bag some national level award. I \nwanted to run a nice story. But my editor said, forget it. It’s no use making the administration \nunhappy. \n \nI did not stop making good reports using the RTI. In addition I had to teach officials the law. \nWorking with this law is fun. But there are problems too. People who knew me well and \ngreeted me with a smile now pretend they do not know me. They do not receive my calls like \nbefore.

But if it is widely used, then it \nwould ensure transparency, accountability and good governance in the country. This is my \nrealization after applying the law upon receiving training from the MRDI. \n \nHow I learnt about RTI \nAt 10 pm June 21, 2011, I got a call from the Shokaler Khobor office. It was National Editor \nTarikul Islam. He asked me to attend a two-day workshop in Dhaka. I took part there. There \nwere 22 others from different districts to l earn about the RTI. I returned to Rangamati and \n \n \n38\nprepared an information request application with  my newly acquired knowledge. To check \nmy flaws, I e-mailed my form to MRDI’s responsible officer Farhana Afroze. She corrected a \nfew things. I was hesitant about filing the application as I am a junior and new in journalism. I \nalso saw that the person to whom I woul d file the application had good terms with my \nseniors. This stopped me from filing the application. \n \nSix months later I got another call from my office on January 15, 2012 asking me to join yet \nanother two-day workshop in Dhaka on January 18-19. I attended it and committed to apply \nthe RTI act. \n",
            " to be given by any organization. But one must have a clear \nconcept about the law. I am saying this on the basis of my experience with the DC office \nover brick kiln. I filed my application on March 28, 2012 asking for on what legal and policy \nbasis the brick kilns were allowed to operate in 10 upazila of Rangamati district and its \nassociated details. \n \nDesignated Officer Shafiqul Islam did not want to give most part of the information that I \nwanted. He gave me this message 10 days later. He said that he could tell where these brick \nkilns are—but my asking for other information was tantamount to harassing him. I told him \nthat as per the law, he should give it in writing what information he would not give to me. \nThis made him somewhat angry. He said, because of the good terms with me, he was \noffering me information against my first question—which I was refusing. After saying this, he \ncalled a peon and asked him to bring the RTI Act book. The peon brought in two books. After \nflipping through some pages, his voice became frustrated, “the government makes law just \nlike that. What’s the point of making a law if it is not implemented.” Afterwards I told him that \nif he refused to give me the information, I will file for an appeal. This saddened him. \n \nOn April 23, I finally got my information. the an swer was: there is no brick kiln in Rangamati. \nIf there is any, it is illegal. This answer addresses all other questions. \n \nThrough this experience, I learnt that if you do not have ideas about the act, officials like \nShafiqul Islam will get away denying your rights—although they themselves do not know \nmuch about the law. \n \nIf you did not get your information after y ou applied and sat back, negative attitude \ndoes not help \nAs I have seen, if you wait for things to happen after application, you will not get information. \nAnd if you develop a negative view about the authority in such a situation, it does not help. \nIts because often your application can get buried under other official works. A negative \nattitude will be a mistake. It happened to me. When I did not get information 15 days after I \napplied for the third time at the Zila Parishad, I thought the Information Officer is ignoring me. \nLater I thought of contacting the DO and found out that I was wrong all along. \n \nI had to give extra time after filing an appeal \nI had to remind the Appellate Authority after filing my appeal and the Appellate Authority, \nwhich was the Rangamati Zila Parishad Ch airman, sought one week’s time and had given \nme the information. I could have lodged a complaint with the Information Commission after \nexpiry of my deadline. That would have taken longer time for me to get my information. \n \n \n \n \n \n40\nTransparency, accountability and good governance have to be ensured: \nI, Himel Chakma, am an individual. Applying the RTI Act just by myself is not enough. My \nexperience says that if hundreds of Himels apply this law, then it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance. People want to know many things. This wish to know is \nnot enough if it is confined within their thoughts. I believe the RTI Act is not just for the \njournalists to apply, but for all to exercise in order to make it a tool to ensure good \ngovernance. Otherwise it will remain as a law only. \n \n \n \n \nClose to a legal battle in \nsearch of information \n \nMotahar Hossain, Senior Staff Reporter, Dainik Gramer Kagoj, Jessore \n \nTwenty five years into my journalism career, t he RTI Act gave me the opportunity to sharpen \nmy profession as well as become a teacher. I become a teacher of the RTI Act for people \ncoming to me with various problems. From 2009, the MRDI created the scope for me to \nbecome an apprentice teacher. \n \nOnce I faced many rejections in getting information from different offices due to \ngovernment’s secrecy law or instructions of the higher authorities. I joined Dainik Gramer \nKagoj in 1999 and worked with various strategies and professional instructions given by my \neditor Mobinul Islam Mobin to gather informati on. Once I turned to",

Back then he said that there should be a \nlaw for professional journalists to get information. \n \nWhen I first met MRDI executive director Hasibur Rahman Mukur at a two-day workshop at \nGramer Kagok on “Election and Political Repor ting” November 2008, I had no idea that the \nMRDI would be a major facilitator in solving a major problem. Eleven days before that on \nOctober 20 the caretaker government published the RTI Ordinance in a gazette. Later the \nelected government modified the ordinance and had it approved at the parliament on March \n29, 2009. I read about the law in the newspaper, but could not yet understand it. \n \nOn July 1 that year, when the law was made effective, I discussed about newspaper articles \non the RTI Act with Mr. Mobin. After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act. Although it was difficult \nfor me to understand from reading that module,  I made some small reports with guidance \nfrom Executive Editor Asad Asaduzzaman. In another workshop in 2010, Mukur of MRDI \ncame and gave me a special award for my reports on the RTI Act.

Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter. He is usually found in the office after the office hours and during that time he \nis usually surrounded by certain teachers. In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports. I also decided to file an information request under the \nRTI Act at the secondary education office. \n \nLegal battle for information \nI went to see the Keshabpur Upazila Secondar y Education officer for three days in February \nthis year with my application but he was not there.

He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act.

A staff named Hazrat Ali put a circular seal \non the signature and advised me to contact their boss. \n \nBut I could not find the boss for the next 10 days. Then I learnt from that office that my \napplication has been given to the boss in a file. The information that I sought is available \nonly with their boss, they said. As the boss did not receive calls from my cell phone, I finally \ngot him using another mobile phone and told him about my application. After 18 working \ndays, I met him near the Social Welfare office at Upazila Parishad building. I reminded \nShekh Firoze Ahmed about the obligation as per Article 9 of the RTI Act to provide me with \nthe information within 20 working days. He casually said, okay, okay and left the place \nquickly. \n \nAs I did not get any information, I filed an appeal on March 28 at the Jessore Secondary \nEducation Office. The district education officer received the appeal sincerely and instantly \ngave the application to his office assistant asking him to send it to Keshabpur Upazila \nSecondary Education Office so that they provide the information. By then I learnt that Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed has been given a stand release. A new official has replaced him and when I \ncontacted him he said his office received no such letter. It compelled me to lodge a \ncomplaint on April 25 to the Information Commission. \n \nAftermath \nThree years after the enactment of the RTI Act only a handful journalists have developed \nsome primary idea about it. To use it efficiently , a professional journalist must know the law \nbetter. It is possible for a journalist to get the maximum information using it.

Then after \napplying, that official with little knowledge on the law start to act weird. This is creating bitter \nexperience for journalists. \n \nIn December 2011, MRDI Executive Director Hasibur Rahman Mukur contacted me over the \nphone informing me about a two-day training on RTI to be held in Dhaka on January 18 and \n19 and that Prothom Alo had nominated me.

I also fixed a subject for \ninvestigation at the training using the act. \n \nWith help from MRDI’s Manager, Programme and Communication Farhana Afroz, I applied \nto the relevant DO to get some information on the Jessore 250-bed General Hospital. My \nbitter experience begins right from the day I went to the hospital to submit my application. \n \nIt was February 8. To submit my application, I s ent my visiting card to the personal assistant \nof Dr Salah Uddin Ahmed, superintendent in charge of the hospital. After a while, I was told \nto come later as the superintendent was busy. \n \nNobody could tell me who is the DO of the hospital.

But many questioned the effectiveness of the pilot dredging, how much was \ndredged, who drew the allocated money and how and on what policy decisions acted behind \nthe pilot capital dredging project. \n \nOn the other hand, there were lots of complaints of corruption and nepotism against a newly \njoined executive engineer of Roads and Highways Department KM Nur-e-Alam Babul. \n \nI was interested to learn about both the cases. \n \nMy introduction to the RTI Act    \nI participated in a MRDI training on the RTI Act when I was working for The Daily Star. I \njoined the Independent later. Luckily Mukur of MRDI did not forget me. \n \nIn the next installment, Mukur talked to the chief reporter of The Independent Mir Mostafizur \nRahman and I was selected further training. There I learnt how to file an information request, \nappeal or a complaint at the Information Commission. \n \nProfessional duties compel me to remain involved with current events most of the times and \nI could naturally access most information. But I always thought I would never get certain \ninformation as the country was not free of corruption and officials and politicians were not \ncompletely transparent. This is why I turned to apply for information on the two subjects. I \nwanted to be sure whether the RTI Act could really be effective. \n \nMy experience \nFebruary 13, 2012. First I went to the Roads and Highways office and found that the \nexecutive engineer had gone to a site. I enquired who was the DO in the office to whom I \ncould submit my application. This surprised everyone in the office. What is that and why? I \nrealized they were unaware of the law. So I talked about it and the purpose of my \napplication. They suggested me to talk to the executive engineer. \n \nI called up the executive engineer over the cell phone. It seemed that upon receiving my call, \nhe felt troubled. He told me that he received no such instructions from the higher authorities. \nThere was no DO and he was never asked to appoint a DO. \n \n \n \n45\nI told him about my application and he wryly said leave the application at the reception. He \nwould look at it. \n \nI left the application at the reception and had my copy received and left for the Water \nDevelopment Board office in Ranigram area of the town. I was glad to learn that there was a \nDO in this office. But the trouble started when I submitted my application. \n \nThe DO of this office was Deputy Assistant Engineer Anwar Sadat. When I went to him to \nsubmit the application, he sought my forgiveness and literally tried to run away from the \noffice. He said he can not do anything without discussing the matter with the executive \nengineer. He can not even receive the application. \n \nI called up the executive engineer and tried to convince him that there was no harm in \nreceiving my application. He is free to give me the information or deny it. At one point, he \ninstructed his subordinate over the mobile phone to take my application. \n \nAs expected I did not get any feedback from the two offices as the deadline expired. On \nMarch 28,  I filed two separate appeals to the executive engineers of the two offices. In \nresponse, on April 3, I received a letter from  executive engineer of roads and highways KM \nNur-e-Alam Babul asking me to collect my information from the Deputy Assistant Engineer at \nhis office. \n \nBefore going there, I called up the relevant official and he gave me an appointment. But \nwhen I went there, he did not turn up or receive my phone calls. Then I got him through the \nmobile phone of another official. This compelled him to come to the office and gave me a \nfantastic excuse for his delay. \n \nWhen I asked him to give me the information,  he offered me tea and cigarette. He started \nsaying that he did not have the information and he was not capable of giving it all. He \npromised me that he would gather them all and send it via a peon.  \n \nBut till date (May 14), he did not send me anything. The Water Development Board also did \nnot give me explanation. \n \nOn May 2, I lodged a complaint with the Information Commission. \n \nFrustration and Expectation \nAs a journalist I did not get timely information using the RTI"

Copy of Whistleblower (protection) Act, 2011 \n \n \n \n3\n \nIntroduction \nThe Right to Information Act, 2009 shines as a milestone in the path of \nBangladesh’s democracy. This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

            ", “okay come back tomorrow. I will see what I can do.” \n \n \n37\n \nI returned to my office feeling down and talked to my editor Mr. Mobin and then he \nsuggested me to talk to Mukur of MRDI. Mukur gave me several suggestions and said, \n“whether you’d take the information or not we will see later. Firstly take the letter asking for \nTk 488,004.” \n \nI returned to magistrate Nahidul Mostak next day. I asked him to give me the letter. But he \ndid not give it to me. He nicely said, “what would you do with the letter. This would cause \nunnecessary problems. It’s better that you take the manual list. It’s not going to cost much.” I \ntried to persuade him to give me the letter, but he did not agree. So I took the photocopy of \nthe manual list for Tk 1300. \n \nBut I utilized an advice of Mukur. I wanted to see the file. In my file I saw the Tk 4.88 lakh \ncost breakdown signed by the magistrate. It said, “Following is the upazila wise cost for \ncollecting through telephone information from DRR and offices.” It adds, Sadar upazila- Tk \n1.60 lakh, Avoynagar Tk 30,000, Bagharpara Tk 50,000, Chowgachha Tk 35,000, \nJhikargachha Tk 35,000, Keshabpur tk 30,000,  Monirampur Tk 70,000, Sharsha Tk 60,000, \ne-service Tk 4X4501= Tk 180,004. Total Tk 488, 004. \n \nAs I looked into the information that I got, I saw what I had suspected from the beginning. All \nthe information services were actually e-services. The list talks about who got which land, \nwhich are the personal land markers etc. This was done either without understanding what \ninformation means in the RTI Act or to get a fake credit to bag some national level award. I \nwanted to run a nice story. But my editor said, forget it. It’s no use making the administration \nunhappy. \n \nI did not stop making good reports using the RTI. In addition I had to teach officials the law. \nWorking with this law is fun. But there are problems too. People who knew me well and \ngreeted me with a smile now pretend they do not know me. They do not receive my calls like \nbefore. When they come face to face, they would say with an embarrassed smile- are you \nwell Mr Asad? \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSome will become friends, \nsome rivals if you use the RTI \nIf RTI is used, it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance in the country \n \n \n \nHimel Chakma, Rangamati Correspondent, Dainik Shokaler Khabor \n \nSome will become friends, some rivals if you use the RTI. But if it is widely used, then it \nwould ensure transparency, accountability and good governance in the country. This is my \nrealization after applying the law upon receiving training from the MRDI. \n \nHow I learnt about RTI \nAt 10 pm June 21, 2011, I got a call from the Shokaler Khobor office. It was National Editor \nTarikul Islam. He asked me to attend a two-day workshop in Dhaka. I took part there. There \nwere 22 others from different districts to l earn about the RTI. I returned to Rangamati and \n \n \n38\nprepared an information request application with  my newly acquired knowledge. To check \nmy flaws, I e-mailed my form to MRDI’s responsible officer Farhana Afroze. She corrected a \nfew things. I was hesitant about filing the application as I am a junior and new in journalism. I \nalso saw that the person to whom I woul d file the application had good terms with my \nseniors. This stopped me from filing the application. \n \nSix months later I got another call from my office on January 15, 2012 asking me to join yet \nanother two-day workshop in Dhaka on January 18-19. I attended it and committed to apply \nthe RTI act. \n",
            " to be given by any organization. But one must have a clear \nconcept about the law. I am saying this on the basis of my experience with the DC office \nover brick kiln. I filed my application on March 28, 2012 asking for on what legal and policy \nbasis the brick kilns were allowed to operate in 10 upazila of Rangamati district and its \nassociated details. \n \nDesignated Officer Shafiqul Islam did not want to give most part of the information that I \nwanted. He gave me this message 10 days later. He said that he could tell where these brick \nkilns are—but my asking for other information was tantamount to harassing him. I told him \nthat as per the law, he should give it in writing what information he would not give to me. \nThis made him somewhat angry. He said, because of the good terms with me, he was \noffering me information against my first question—which I was refusing. After saying this, he \ncalled a peon and asked him to bring the RTI Act book. The peon brought in two books. After \nflipping through some pages, his voice became frustrated, “the government makes law just \nlike that. What’s the point of making a law if it is not implemented.” Afterwards I told him that \nif he refused to give me the information, I will file for an appeal. This saddened him. \n \nOn April 23, I finally got my information. the an swer was: there is no brick kiln in Rangamati. \nIf there is any, it is illegal. This answer addresses all other questions. \n \nThrough this experience, I learnt that if you do not have ideas about the act, officials like \nShafiqul Islam will get away denying your rights—although they themselves do not know \nmuch about the law. \n \nIf you did not get your information after y ou applied and sat back, negative attitude \ndoes not help \nAs I have seen, if you wait for things to happen after application, you will not get information. \nAnd if you develop a negative view about the authority in such a situation, it does not help. \nIts because often your application can get buried under other official works. A negative \nattitude will be a mistake. It happened to me. When I did not get information 15 days after I \napplied for the third time at the Zila Parishad, I thought the Information Officer is ignoring me. \nLater I thought of contacting the DO and found out that I was wrong all along. \n \nI had to give extra time after filing an appeal \nI had to remind the Appellate Authority after filing my appeal and the Appellate Authority, \nwhich was the Rangamati Zila Parishad Ch airman, sought one week’s time and had given \nme the information. I could have lodged a complaint with the Information Commission after \nexpiry of my deadline. That would have taken longer time for me to get my information. \n \n \n \n \n \n40\nTransparency, accountability and good governance have to be ensured: \nI, Himel Chakma, am an individual. Applying the RTI Act just by myself is not enough. My \nexperience says that if hundreds of Himels apply this law, then it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance. People want to know many things. This wish to know is \nnot enough if it is confined within their thoughts. I believe the RTI Act is not just for the \njournalists to apply, but for all to exercise in order to make it a tool to ensure good \ngovernance. Otherwise it will remain as a law only. \n \n \n \n \nClose to a legal battle in \nsearch of information \n \nMotahar Hossain, Senior Staff Reporter, Dainik Gramer Kagoj, Jessore \n \nTwenty five years into my journalism career, t he RTI Act gave me the opportunity to sharpen \nmy profession as well as become a teacher. I become a teacher of the RTI Act for people \ncoming to me with various problems. From 2009, the MRDI created the scope for me to \nbecome an apprentice teacher. \n \nOnce I faced many rejections in getting information from different offices due to \ngovernment’s secrecy law or instructions of the higher authorities. I joined Dainik Gramer \nKagoj in 1999 and worked with various strategies and professional instructions given by my \neditor Mobinul Islam Mobin to gather informati on. Once I turned to",
            " late education minister \nASHK Sedeque’s senior information offi cer Dr Mohammad Hannan when I was denied \ninformation from the Water Development Board. Back then he said that there should be a \nlaw for professional journalists to get information. \n \nWhen I first met MRDI executive director Hasibur Rahman Mukur at a two-day workshop at \nGramer Kagok on “Election and Political Repor ting” November 2008, I had no idea that the \nMRDI would be a major facilitator in solving a major problem. Eleven days before that on \nOctober 20 the caretaker government published the RTI Ordinance in a gazette. Later the \nelected government modified the ordinance and had it approved at the parliament on March \n29, 2009. I read about the law in the newspaper, but could not yet understand it. \n \nOn July 1 that year, when the law was made effective, I discussed about newspaper articles \non the RTI Act with Mr. Mobin. After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act. Although it was difficult \nfor me to understand from reading that module,  I made some small reports with guidance \nfrom Executive Editor Asad Asaduzzaman. In another workshop in 2010, Mukur of MRDI \ncame and gave me a special award for my reports on the RTI Act. Finally I got further \nopportunity to sharpen my knowledge by attendi ng another two- day training by the MRDI in \nDhaka on January 18 and 19. \n  \nThoughts on the subject \nThere had been a lot of complaints over recruitment of teachers after politicians were \nappointed head of management committee of educational institutions. Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter. He is usually found in the office after the office hours and during that time he \nis usually surrounded by certain teachers. In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports. I also decided to file an information request under the \nRTI Act at the secondary education office. \n \nLegal battle for information \nI went to see the Keshabpur Upazila Secondar y Education officer for three days in February \nthis year with my application but he was not there. As he was not available I went to the DO \nof the office, Office Assistant Ruhul Amin on February 6. As I requested him to take my \napplication, he became busy typing in a computer. After waiting for 10 minutes, I requested \nhim again. He took it, looked at it and put it down. I forwarded another copy asking him to \nsign it as a received copy. He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act. I told him that this letter is on a \nform prescribed by a government gazette.

A staff named Hazrat Ali put a circular seal \non the signature and advised me to contact their boss. \n \nBut I could not find the boss for the next 10 days. Then I learnt from that office that my \napplication has been given to the boss in a file. The information that I sought is available \nonly with their boss, they said. As the boss did not receive calls from my cell phone, I finally \ngot him using another mobile phone and told him about my application. After 18 working \ndays, I met him near the Social Welfare office at Upazila Parishad building. I reminded \nShekh Firoze Ahmed about the obligation as per Article 9 of the RTI Act to provide me with \nthe information within 20 working days. He casually said, okay, okay and left the place \nquickly. \n \nAs I did not get any information, I filed an appeal on March 28 at the Jessore Secondary \nEducation Office. The district education officer received the appeal sincerely and instantly \ngave the application to his office assistant asking him to send it to Keshabpur Upazila \nSecondary Education Office so that they provide the information. By then I learnt that Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed has been given a stand release. A new official has replaced him and when I \ncontacted him he said his office received no such letter. It compelled me to lodge a \ncomplaint on April 25 to the Information Commission. \n \nAftermath \nThree years after the enactment of the RTI Act only a handful journalists have developed \nsome primary idea about it. To use it efficiently , a professional journalist must know the law \nbetter. It is possible for a journalist to get the maximum information using it.

Then after \napplying, that official with little knowledge on the law start to act weird.

This two-day training opened up a new horizon \nof experience for me. \n \nI got some detailed ideas about the RTI Act at the training. I also fixed a subject for \ninvestigation at the training using the act. \n \nWith help from MRDI’s Manager, Programme and Communication Farhana Afroz, I applied \nto the relevant DO to get some information on the Jessore 250-bed General Hospital.

To submit my application, I s ent my visiting card to the personal assistant \nof Dr Salah Uddin Ahmed, superintendent in charge of the hospital. After a while, I was told \nto come later as the superintendent was busy. \n \nNobody could tell me who is the DO of the hospital.

But many questioned the effectiveness of the pilot dredging, how much was \ndredged, who drew the allocated money and how and on what policy decisions acted behind \nthe pilot capital dredging project. \n \nOn the other hand, there were lots of complaints of corruption and nepotism against a newly \njoined executive engineer of Roads and Highways Department KM Nur-e-Alam Babul. \n \nI was interested to learn about both the cases. \n \nMy introduction to the RTI Act    \nI participated in a MRDI training on the RTI Act when I was working for The Daily Star. I \njoined the Independent later. Luckily Mukur of MRDI did not forget me. \n \nIn the next installment, Mukur talked to the chief reporter of The Independent Mir Mostafizur \nRahman and I was selected further training. There I learnt how to file an information request, \nappeal or a complaint at the Information Commission. \n \nProfessional duties compel me to remain involved with current events most of the times and \nI could naturally access most information. But I always thought I would never get certain \ninformation as the country was not free of corruption and officials and politicians were not \ncompletely transparent. This is why I turned to apply for information on the two subjects. I \nwanted to be sure whether the RTI Act could really be effective. \n \nMy experience \nFebruary 13, 2012. First I went to the Roads and Highways office and found that the \nexecutive engineer had gone to a site. I enquired who was the DO in the office to whom I \ncould submit my application. This surprised everyone in the office. What is that and why? I \nrealized they were unaware of the law. So I talked about it and the purpose of my \napplication. They suggested me to talk to the executive engineer. \n \nI called up the executive engineer over the cell phone. It seemed that upon receiving my call, \nhe felt troubled. He told me that he received no such instructions from the higher authorities. \nThere was no DO and he was never asked to appoint a DO. \n \n \n \n45\nI told him about my application and he wryly said leave the application at the reception. He \nwould look at it. \n \nI left the application at the reception and had my copy received and left for the Water \nDevelopment Board office in Ranigram area of the town. I was glad to learn that there was a \nDO in this office. But the trouble started when I submitted my application. \n \nThe DO of this office was Deputy Assistant Engineer Anwar Sadat. When I went to him to \nsubmit the application, he sought my forgiveness and literally tried to run away from the \noffice. He said he can not do anything without discussing the matter with the executive \nengineer. He can not even receive the application. \n \nI called up the executive engineer and tried to convince him that there was no harm in \nreceiving my application. He is free to give me the information or deny it.

A staff named Hazrat Ali put a circular seal \non the signature and advised me to contact their boss. \n \nBut I could not find the boss for the next 10 days. Then I learnt from that office that my \napplication has been given to the boss in a file. The information that I sought is available \nonly with their boss, they said. As the boss did not receive calls from my cell phone, I finally \ngot him using another mobile phone and told him about my application. After 18 working \ndays, I met him near the Social Welfare office at Upazila Parishad building. I reminded \nShekh Firoze Ahmed about the obligation as per Article 9 of the RTI Act to provide me with \nthe information within 20 working days. He casually said, okay, okay and left the place \nquickly. \n \nAs I did not get any information, I filed an appeal on March 28 at the Jessore Secondary \nEducation Office. The district education officer received the appeal sincerely and instantly \ngave the application to his office assistant asking him to send it to Keshabpur Upazila \nSecondary Education Office so that they provide the information. By then I learnt that Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed has been given a stand release. A new official has replaced him and when I \ncontacted him he said his office received no such letter. It compelled me to lodge a \ncomplaint on April 25 to the Information Commission. \n \nAftermath \nThree years after the enactment of the RTI Act only a handful journalists have developed \nsome primary idea about it. To use it efficiently , a professional journalist must know the law \nbetter. It is possible for a journalist to get the maximum information using it. The law has not \nyet gained recognition among general people. The government needs to widely publicise \nabout it and make the information providing officials aware of it. \n \n \n42\n \nBut you’re bound to give \nthe information \n \nMonirul Islam, District Correspondent, Prothom Alo, Jessore \n \n“Cannot give you photocopies of government lett ers, if you want you can see them.” These \nwere the typical let downs for me till two years back at different government offices. \n \nAfter the RTI Act 2009, officials tell me to apply in accordance with the law. Then after \napplying, that official with little knowledge on the law start to act weird. This is creating bitter \nexperience for journalists. \n \nIn December 2011, MRDI Executive Director Hasibur Rahman Mukur contacted me over the \nphone informing me about a two-day training on RTI to be held in Dhaka on January 18 and \n19 and that Prothom Alo had nominated me. This two-day training opened up a new horizon \nof experience for me. \n \nI got some detailed ideas about the RTI Act at the training. I also fixed a subject for \ninvestigation at the training using the act. \n \nWith help from MRDI’s Manager, Programme and Communication Farhana Afroz, I applied \nto the relevant DO to get some information on the Jessore 250-bed General Hospital. My \nbitter experience begins right from the day I went to the hospital to submit my application. \n \nIt was February 8. To submit my application, I s ent my visiting card to the personal assistant \nof Dr Salah Uddin Ahmed, superintendent in charge of the hospital. After a while, I was told \nto come later as the superintendent was busy. \n \nNobody could tell me who is the DO of the hospital. Later I submitted the application to the \nadministrative officer Abdul Hamid. \n \nI sought five information as the followings: A. list of doctors absent for more than three \nmonths and reasons for their absence. B. List of non-functional equipment in operation \ntheatre, pediatric ward and X-Ray department and names of concerned technicians. C. \nphotocopy of the latest report sent to the higher authorities to repair these equipment. D. list \nof excess staffs employed by the hospital’s own management and the government approved \norganogram. E. Latest written information on opening the coronary care unit. \n \nTwenty days passed without any response from the hospital. On March 22, I filed an appeal \nto Khulna Divisional Director (Health) AKM Ab dus Samad Miah. On",
            " late education minister \nASHK Sedeque’s senior information offi cer Dr Mohammad Hannan when I was denied \ninformation from the Water Development Board. Back then he said that there should be a \nlaw for professional journalists to get information. \n \nWhen I first met MRDI executive director Hasibur Rahman Mukur at a two-day workshop at \nGramer Kagok on “Election and Political Repor ting” November 2008, I had no idea that the \nMRDI would be a major facilitator in solving a major problem. Eleven days before that on \nOctober 20 the caretaker government published the RTI Ordinance in a gazette. Later the \nelected government modified the ordinance and had it approved at the parliament on March \n29, 2009. I read about the law in the newspaper, but could not yet understand it. \n \nOn July 1 that year, when the law was made effective, I discussed about newspaper articles \non the RTI Act with Mr. Mobin. After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act. Although it was difficult \nfor me to understand from reading that module,  I made some small reports with guidance \nfrom Executive Editor Asad Asaduzzaman. In another workshop in 2010, Mukur of MRDI \ncame and gave me a special award for my reports on the RTI Act. Finally I got further \nopportunity to sharpen my knowledge by attendi ng another two- day training by the MRDI in \nDhaka on January 18 and 19. \n  \nThoughts on the subject \nThere had been a lot of complaints over recruitment of teachers after politicians were \nappointed head of management committee of educational institutions. Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter. He is usually found in the office after the office hours and during that time he \nis usually surrounded by certain teachers. In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports. I also decided to file an information request under the \nRTI Act at the secondary education office. \n \nLegal battle for information \nI went to see the Keshabpur Upazila Secondar y Education officer for three days in February \nthis year with my application but he was not there. As he was not available I went to the DO \nof the office, Office Assistant Ruhul Amin on February 6. As I requested him to take my \napplication, he became busy typing in a computer. After waiting for 10 minutes, I requested \nhim again. He took it, looked at it and put it down. I forwarded another copy asking him to \nsign it as a received copy. He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act. I told him that this letter is on a \nform prescribed by a government gazette. He gave it back saying, give it to the boss when \nhe returns. \n \nI told him that I came to meet his boss for the last three days. He said he was busy with the \n",

But many questioned the effectiveness of the pilot dredging, how much was \ndredged, who drew the allocated money and how and on what policy decisions acted behind \nthe pilot capital dredging project. \n \nOn the other hand, there were lots of complaints of corruption and nepotism against a newly \njoined executive engineer of Roads and Highways Department KM Nur-e-Alam Babul. \n \nI was interested to learn about both the cases. \n \nMy introduction to the RTI Act    \nI participated in a MRDI training on the RTI Act when I was working for The Daily Star. I \njoined the Independent later. Luckily Mukur of MRDI did not forget me. \n \nIn the next installment, Mukur talked to the chief reporter of The Independent Mir Mostafizur \nRahman and I was selected further training. There I learnt how to file an information request, \nappeal or a complaint at the Information Commission. \n \nProfessional duties compel me to remain involved with current events most of the times and \nI could naturally access most information. But I always thought I would never get certain \ninformation as the country was not free of corruption and officials and politicians were not \ncompletely transparent. This is why I turned to apply for information on the two subjects. I \nwanted to be sure whether the RTI Act could really be effective. \n \nMy experience \nFebruary 13, 2012. First I went to the Roads and Highways office and found that the \nexecutive engineer had gone to a site. I enquired who was the DO in the office to whom I \ncould submit my application. This surprised everyone in the office. What is that and why? I \nrealized they were unaware of the law. So I talked about it and the purpose of my \napplication. They suggested me to talk to the executive engineer. \n \nI called up the executive engineer over the cell phone. It seemed that upon receiving my call, \nhe felt troubled. He told me that he received no such instructions from the higher authorities. \nThere was no DO and he was never asked to appoint a DO. \n \n \n \n45\nI told him about my application and he wryly said leave the application at the reception. He \nwould look at it. \n \nI left the application at the reception and had my copy received and left for the Water \nDevelopment Board office in Ranigram area of the town. I was glad to learn that there was a \nDO in this office. But the trouble started when I submitted my application. \n \nThe DO of this office was Deputy Assistant Engineer Anwar Sadat. When I went to him to \nsubmit the application, he sought my forgiveness and literally tried to run away from the \noffice. He said he can not do anything without discussing the matter with the executive \nengineer. He can not even receive the application. \n \nI called up the executive engineer and tried to convince him that there was no harm in \nreceiving my application. He is free to give me the information or deny it. At one point, he \ninstructed his subordinate over the mobile phone to take my application. \n \nAs expected I did not get any feedback from the two offices as the deadline expired. On \nMarch 28,  I filed two separate appeals to the executive engineers of the two offices. In \nresponse, on April 3, I received a letter from  executive engineer of roads and highways KM \nNur-e-Alam Babul asking me to collect my information from the Deputy Assistant Engineer at \nhis office. \n \nBefore going there, I called up the relevant official and he gave me an appointment.

            ", “okay come back tomorrow. I will see what I can do.” \n \n \n37\n \nI returned to my office feeling down and talked to my editor Mr. Mobin and then he \nsuggested me to talk to Mukur of MRDI. Mukur gave me several suggestions and said, \n“whether you’d take the information or not we will see later. Firstly take the letter asking for \nTk 488,004.” \n \nI returned to magistrate Nahidul Mostak next day. I asked him to give me the letter. But he \ndid not give it to me. He nicely said, “what would you do with the letter. This would cause \nunnecessary problems. It’s better that you take the manual list. It’s not going to cost much.” I \ntried to persuade him to give me the letter, but he did not agree. So I took the photocopy of \nthe manual list for Tk 1300. \n \nBut I utilized an advice of Mukur. I wanted to see the file. In my file I saw the Tk 4.88 lakh \ncost breakdown signed by the magistrate. It said, “Following is the upazila wise cost for \ncollecting through telephone information from DRR and offices.” It adds, Sadar upazila- Tk \n1.60 lakh, Avoynagar Tk 30,000, Bagharpara Tk 50,000, Chowgachha Tk 35,000, \nJhikargachha Tk 35,000, Keshabpur tk 30,000,  Monirampur Tk 70,000, Sharsha Tk 60,000, \ne-service Tk 4X4501= Tk 180,004. Total Tk 488, 004. \n \nAs I looked into the information that I got, I saw what I had suspected from the beginning. All \nthe information services were actually e-services. The list talks about who got which land, \nwhich are the personal land markers etc. This was done either without understanding what \ninformation means in the RTI Act or to get a fake credit to bag some national level award. I \nwanted to run a nice story. But my editor said, forget it. It’s no use making the administration \nunhappy. \n \nI did not stop making good reports using the RTI. In addition I had to teach officials the law. \nWorking with this law is fun. But there are problems too. People who knew me well and \ngreeted me with a smile now pretend they do not know me. They do not receive my calls like \nbefore. When they come face to face, they would say with an embarrassed smile- are you \nwell Mr Asad? \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSome will become friends, \nsome rivals if you use the RTI \nIf RTI is used, it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance in the country \n \n \n \nHimel Chakma, Rangamati Correspondent, Dainik Shokaler Khabor \n \nSome will become friends, some rivals if you use the RTI. But if it is widely used, then it \nwould ensure transparency, accountability and good governance in the country. This is my \nrealization after applying the law upon receiving training from the MRDI. \n \nHow I learnt about RTI \nAt 10 pm June 21, 2011, I got a call from the Shokaler Khobor office. It was National Editor \nTarikul Islam. He asked me to attend a two-day workshop in Dhaka. I took part there. There \nwere 22 others from different districts to l earn about the RTI. I returned to Rangamati and \n \n \n38\nprepared an information request application with  my newly acquired knowledge. To check \nmy flaws, I e-mailed my form to MRDI’s responsible officer Farhana Afroze. She corrected a \nfew things. I was hesitant about filing the application as I am a junior and new in journalism. I \nalso saw that the person to whom I woul d file the application had good terms with my \nseniors. This stopped me from filing the application. \n \nSix months later I got another call from my office on January 15, 2012 asking me to join yet \nanother two-day workshop in Dhaka on January 18-19. I attended it and committed to apply \nthe RTI act. \n",
            " to be given by any organization. But one must have a clear \nconcept about the law. I am saying this on the basis of my experience with the DC office \nover brick kiln. I filed my application on March 28, 2012 asking for on what legal and policy \nbasis the brick kilns were allowed to operate in 10 upazila of Rangamati district and its \nassociated details. \n \nDesignated Officer Shafiqul Islam did not want to give most part of the information that I \nwanted. He gave me this message 10 days later. He said that he could tell where these brick \nkilns are—but my asking for other information was tantamount to harassing him. I told him \nthat as per the law, he should give it in writing what information he would not give to me. \nThis made him somewhat angry. He said, because of the good terms with me, he was \noffering me information against my first question—which I was refusing. After saying this, he \ncalled a peon and asked him to bring the RTI Act book. The peon brought in two books. After \nflipping through some pages, his voice became frustrated, “the government makes law just \nlike that. What’s the point of making a law if it is not implemented.” Afterwards I told him that \nif he refused to give me the information, I will file for an appeal. This saddened him. \n \nOn April 23, I finally got my information. the an swer was: there is no brick kiln in Rangamati. \nIf there is any, it is illegal. This answer addresses all other questions. \n \nThrough this experience, I learnt that if you do not have ideas about the act, officials like \nShafiqul Islam will get away denying your rights—although they themselves do not know \nmuch about the law. \n \nIf you did not get your information after y ou applied and sat back, negative attitude \ndoes not help \nAs I have seen, if you wait for things to happen after application, you will not get information. \nAnd if you develop a negative view about the authority in such a situation, it does not help. \nIts because often your application can get buried under other official works. A negative \nattitude will be a mistake. It happened to me. When I did not get information 15 days after I \napplied for the third time at the Zila Parishad, I thought the Information Officer is ignoring me. \nLater I thought of contacting the DO and found out that I was wrong all along. \n \nI had to give extra time after filing an appeal \nI had to remind the Appellate Authority after filing my appeal and the Appellate Authority, \nwhich was the Rangamati Zila Parishad Ch airman, sought one week’s time and had given \nme the information. I could have lodged a complaint with the Information Commission after \nexpiry of my deadline. That would have taken longer time for me to get my information. \n \n \n \n \n \n40\nTransparency, accountability and good governance have to be ensured: \nI, Himel Chakma, am an individual. Applying the RTI Act just by myself is not enough. My \nexperience says that if hundreds of Himels apply this law, then it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance. People want to know many things. This wish to know is \nnot enough if it is confined within their thoughts. I believe the RTI Act is not just for the \njournalists to apply, but for all to exercise in order to make it a tool to ensure good \ngovernance. Otherwise it will remain as a law only. \n \n \n \n \nClose to a legal battle in \nsearch of information \n \nMotahar Hossain, Senior Staff Reporter, Dainik Gramer Kagoj, Jessore \n \nTwenty five years into my journalism career, t he RTI Act gave me the opportunity to sharpen \nmy profession as well as become a teacher. I become a teacher of the RTI Act for people \ncoming to me with various problems. From 2009, the MRDI created the scope for me to \nbecome an apprentice teacher. \n \nOnce I faced many rejections in getting information from different offices due to \ngovernment’s secrecy law or instructions of the higher authorities. I joined Dainik Gramer \nKagoj in 1999 and worked with various strategies and professional instructions given by my \neditor Mobinul Islam Mobin to gather informati on. Once I turned to",

This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

            ", “okay come back tomorrow. I will see what I can do.” \n \n \n37\n \nI returned to my office feeling down and talked to my editor Mr. Mobin and then he \nsuggested me to talk to Mukur of MRDI. Mukur gave me several suggestions and said, \n“whether you’d take the information or not we will see later. Firstly take the letter asking for \nTk 488,004.” \n \nI returned to magistrate Nahidul Mostak next day. I asked him to give me the letter. But he \ndid not give it to me. He nicely said, “what would you do with the letter. This would cause \nunnecessary problems. It’s better that you take the manual list. It’s not going to cost much.” I \ntried to persuade him to give me the letter, but he did not agree. So I took the photocopy of \nthe manual list for Tk 1300. \n \nBut I utilized an advice of Mukur. I wanted to see the file. In my file I saw the Tk 4.88 lakh \ncost breakdown signed by the magistrate. It said, “Following is the upazila wise cost for \ncollecting through telephone information from DRR and offices.” It adds, Sadar upazila- Tk \n1.60 lakh, Avoynagar Tk 30,000, Bagharpara Tk 50,000, Chowgachha Tk 35,000, \nJhikargachha Tk 35,000, Keshabpur tk 30,000,  Monirampur Tk 70,000, Sharsha Tk 60,000, \ne-service Tk 4X4501= Tk 180,004. Total Tk 488, 004. \n \nAs I looked into the information that I got, I saw what I had suspected from the beginning. All \nthe information services were actually e-services. The list talks about who got which land, \nwhich are the personal land markers etc. This was done either without understanding what \ninformation means in the RTI Act or to get a fake credit to bag some national level award. I \nwanted to run a nice story. But my editor said, forget it. It’s no use making the administration \nunhappy. \n \nI did not stop making good reports using the RTI. In addition I had to teach officials the law. \nWorking with this law is fun. But there are problems too. People who knew me well and \ngreeted me with a smile now pretend they do not know me. They do not receive my calls like \nbefore. When they come face to face, they would say with an embarrassed smile- are you \nwell Mr Asad? \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSome will become friends, \nsome rivals if you use the RTI \nIf RTI is used, it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance in the country \n \n \n \nHimel Chakma, Rangamati Correspondent, Dainik Shokaler Khabor \n \nSome will become friends, some rivals if you use the RTI. But if it is widely used, then it \nwould ensure transparency, accountability and good governance in the country. This is my \nrealization after applying the law upon receiving training from the MRDI. \n \nHow I learnt about RTI \nAt 10 pm June 21, 2011, I got a call from the Shokaler Khobor office. It was National Editor \nTarikul Islam. He asked me to attend a two-day workshop in Dhaka. I took part there. There \nwere 22 others from different districts to l earn about the RTI. I returned to Rangamati and \n \n \n38\nprepared an information request application with  my newly acquired knowledge. To check \nmy flaws, I e-mailed my form to MRDI’s responsible officer Farhana Afroze. She corrected a \nfew things. I was hesitant about filing the application as I am a junior and new in journalism. I \nalso saw that the person to whom I woul d file the application had good terms with my \nseniors. This stopped me from filing the application. \n \nSix months later I got another call from my office on January 15, 2012 asking me to join yet \nanother two-day workshop in Dhaka on January 18-19. I attended it and committed to apply \nthe RTI act. \n",
            " to be given by any organization. But one must have a clear \nconcept about the law. I am saying this on the basis of my experience with the DC office \nover brick kiln. I filed my application on March 28, 2012 asking for on what legal and policy \nbasis the brick kilns were allowed to operate in 10 upazila of Rangamati district and its \nassociated details. \n \nDesignated Officer Shafiqul Islam did not want to give most part of the information that I \nwanted. He gave me this message 10 days later. He said that he could tell where these brick \nkilns are—but my asking for other information was tantamount to harassing him. I told him \nthat as per the law, he should give it in writing what information he would not give to me. \nThis made him somewhat angry. He said, because of the good terms with me, he was \noffering me information against my first question—which I was refusing. After saying this, he \ncalled a peon and asked him to bring the RTI Act book. The peon brought in two books. After \nflipping through some pages, his voice became frustrated, “the government makes law just \nlike that. What’s the point of making a law if it is not implemented.” Afterwards I told him that \nif he refused to give me the information, I will file for an appeal. This saddened him. \n \nOn April 23, I finally got my information. the an swer was: there is no brick kiln in Rangamati. \nIf there is any, it is illegal. This answer addresses all other questions. \n \nThrough this experience, I learnt that if you do not have ideas about the act, officials like \nShafiqul Islam will get away denying your rights—although they themselves do not know \nmuch about the law. \n \nIf you did not get your information after y ou applied and sat back, negative attitude \ndoes not help \nAs I have seen, if you wait for things to happen after application, you will not get information. \nAnd if you develop a negative view about the authority in such a situation, it does not help. \nIts because often your application can get buried under other official works. A negative \nattitude will be a mistake. It happened to me. When I did not get information 15 days after I \napplied for the third time at the Zila Parishad, I thought the Information Officer is ignoring me. \nLater I thought of contacting the DO and found out that I was wrong all along. \n \nI had to give extra time after filing an appeal \nI had to remind the Appellate Authority after filing my appeal and the Appellate Authority, \nwhich was the Rangamati Zila Parishad Ch airman, sought one week’s time and had given \nme the information. I could have lodged a complaint with the Information Commission after \nexpiry of my deadline. That would have taken longer time for me to get my information. \n \n \n \n \n \n40\nTransparency, accountability and good governance have to be ensured: \nI, Himel Chakma, am an individual. Applying the RTI Act just by myself is not enough. My \nexperience says that if hundreds of Himels apply this law, then it would ensure transparency, \naccountability and good governance. People want to know many things. This wish to know is \nnot enough if it is confined within their thoughts. I believe the RTI Act is not just for the \njournalists to apply, but for all to exercise in order to make it a tool to ensure good \ngovernance. Otherwise it will remain as a law only. \n \n \n \n \nClose to a legal battle in \nsearch of information \n \nMotahar Hossain, Senior Staff Reporter, Dainik Gramer Kagoj, Jessore \n \nTwenty five years into my journalism career, t he RTI Act gave me the opportunity to sharpen \nmy profession as well as become a teacher. I become a teacher of the RTI Act for people \ncoming to me with various problems. From 2009, the MRDI created the scope for me to \nbecome an apprentice teacher. \n \nOnce I faced many rejections in getting information from different offices due to \ngovernment’s secrecy law or instructions of the higher authorities. I joined Dainik Gramer \nKagoj in 1999 and worked with various strategies and professional instructions given by my \neditor Mobinul Islam Mobin to gather informati on. Once I turned to",
            " late education minister \nASHK Sedeque’s senior information offi cer Dr Mohammad Hannan when I was denied \ninformation from the Water Development Board. Back then he said that there should be a \nlaw for professional journalists to get information. \n \nWhen I first met MRDI executive director Hasibur Rahman Mukur at a two-day workshop at \nGramer Kagok on “Election and Political Repor ting” November 2008, I had no idea that the \nMRDI would be a major facilitator in solving a major problem. Eleven days before that on \nOctober 20 the caretaker government published the RTI Ordinance in a gazette. Later the \nelected government modified the ordinance and had it approved at the parliament on March \n29, 2009. I read about the law in the newspaper, but could not yet understand it. \n \nOn July 1 that year, when the law was made effective, I discussed about newspaper articles \non the RTI Act with Mr. Mobin. After a few days, Mobin told me that the MRDI will provide \ntraining to Gramer Kagoj journalists on t he RTI Act. On 5 and 6 September, 2009 the MRDI \ngave us a 272-page in-house training module on the use of RTI Act in investigating \njournalism on corruption. That was the first time when I saw RTI Act. Although it was difficult \nfor me to understand from reading that module,  I made some small reports with guidance \nfrom Executive Editor Asad Asaduzzaman. In another workshop in 2010, Mukur of MRDI \ncame and gave me a special award for my reports on the RTI Act. Finally I got further \nopportunity to sharpen my knowledge by attendi ng another two- day training by the MRDI in \nDhaka on January 18 and 19. \n  \nThoughts on the subject \nThere had been a lot of complaints over recruitment of teachers after politicians were \nappointed head of management committee of educational institutions. Most of the heads of \neducation institutions and teacher- representatives of Keshabpur upazila in Jessore district \nwere aggrieved and helpless. But they were reluctant to raise the allegation directly to avoid \nbecoming victims of conflicts with the polit icians. I gathered that although different peoples \n \n \n41\nwere involved in bribery in different recruitment boards, there was a common participant who \ncontrolled all the boards. That was Keshabpur Upazila secondary education officer Shekh \nFiroze Ahmed. Whenever I went to him with letters of allegations over recruitment, he has \nalways pointed his finger to the heads of educat ional institutions or committee chairmen and \navoided his responsibility. It was very difficult to find him during office hours. But all files \nrelated to recruitments are in his control. I learnt from my sources that others are in the dark \non this matter. He is usually found in the office after the office hours and during that time he \nis usually surrounded by certain teachers. In addition to dealing with recruitment, he is busy \nwith elections in different education institutions. He had the full blessings of the MPs and top \nruling party men in all the areas. He acts on their orders. Therefore I gave up hopes of \ngetting information from him and instead I gathered information on complaints from another \ndepartment to make separate reports. I also decided to file an information request under the \nRTI Act at the secondary education office. \n \nLegal battle for information \nI went to see the Keshabpur Upazila Secondar y Education officer for three days in February \nthis year with my application but he was not there. As he was not available I went to the DO \nof the office, Office Assistant Ruhul Amin on February 6. As I requested him to take my \napplication, he became busy typing in a computer. After waiting for 10 minutes, I requested \nhim again. He took it, looked at it and put it down. I forwarded another copy asking him to \nsign it as a received copy. He wanted to know what organization did I represent. He said he \nheard about human rights organizations, but never anything about information rights \norganization. Therefore he would not sign to receive any letter without any reference number \non it. I gave him my identity and talked about the RTI Act. I told him that this letter is on a \nform prescribed by a government gazette. He gave it back saying, give it to the boss when \nhe returns. \n \nI told him that I came to meet his boss for the last three days. He said he was busy with the \n"

This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"
