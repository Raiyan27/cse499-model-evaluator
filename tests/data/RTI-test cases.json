        "expected_output": "The Right to Information (RTI) law plays a critical role in promoting governmental accountability and empowering citizens in Bangladesh. By ensuring maximum disclosure and proactive communication, the RTI law holds authorities accountable for their actions. Citizens can demand information regarding government activities, policies, expenditures, and NGO operations, thereby facilitating transparency.\n\nThis law recognizes that information is a public asset, underscored by the Bangladesh Constitution, which states that the people are the ultimate owners of state power. The RTI law establishes mechanisms for citizens to access information without needing to justify their requests, thereby democratizing information access.\n\nMoreover, the RTI law aids marginalized communities by allowing them to seek assistance from NGOs in requesting information, addressing their specific needs, and promoting their rights. Through this framework, the RTI law not only informs but also empowers citizens to engage actively in governance, ensuring a more participatory democratic process. Thus, the RTI law embodies the principles of accountability and citizen empowerment, essential for good governance.",

            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field",

This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people.

This proactive engagement could encourage public officials to act responsibly, knowing their decisions are subject to public inquiry.\n\nIncreased transparency would likely reduce corruption, as citizens could expose malpractices in projects like the Padma Bridge and demand accountability from those in power. Additionally, marginalized communities could utilize the RTI law with assistance from NGOs to seek information about their rights and entitlements, thereby promoting social justice.\n\nUltimately, the collective use of the RTI law could strengthen democratic processes, ensuring that the government operates in the best interest of its citizens and is held accountable for its actions. This shift would create a more engaged citizenry that actively participates in governance and contributes to a more equitable society.",

            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field",

Copy of Whistleblower (protection) Act, 2011 \n \n \n \n3\n \nIntroduction \nThe Right to Information Act, 2009 shines as a milestone in the path of \nBangladesh’s democracy. This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the "

This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

Copy of Whistleblower (protection) Act, 2011 \n \n \n \n3\n \nIntroduction \nThe Right to Information Act, 2009 shines as a milestone in the path of \nBangladesh’s democracy. This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field",

If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost.

        "expected_output": "The principles of the Right to Information (RTI) law in Bangladesh emphasize maximum information disclosure, proactive transparency, accountability, and ease of access to information. These principles align closely with transparency measures in other democratic nations, which often prioritize similar goals to ensure citizen engagement and government accountability. \n\nFor instance, many democratic countries implement laws that guarantee citizens access to government records and allow for the questioning of official decisions, reflecting articles like Bangladesh’s RTI that mandate transparency in government dealings. Additionally, proactive disclosure of information, which is a core principle of the Bangladeshi RTI law, is also common in countries such as the United States and Canada, where certain documents and data must be made publicly available without needing a specific request.\n\nFurthermore, like the RTI law’s provisions for free or low-cost access to information, many democratic systems have similar stipulations to facilitate citizen inquiries without financial burdens. Overall, while specific implementations may differ, the foundational goals of promoting transparency and accountability through citizen access to information resonate across democratic frameworks globally.",

            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field",

Copy of Whistleblower (protection) Act, 2011 \n \n \n \n3\n \nIntroduction \nThe Right to Information Act, 2009 shines as a milestone in the path of \nBangladesh’s democracy. This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the "

        "expected_output": "The Right to Information (RTI) Act of 2009 in Bangladesh plays a crucial role in enhancing governmental transparency and accountability within the civil sector. By recognizing citizens' rights to access information, the RTI law empowers individuals to participate actively in governance. It obligates authorities, including government bodies, NGOs funded by public money, and foreign aid organizations, to disclose information related to their activities, expenditures, and policies.\n\nKey aspects of the RTI law that promote transparency include:\n\n1. **Mandatory Disclosure**: Authorities are required to proactively disclose information, reducing barriers to accessing essential data.\n2. **Public Participation**: The RTI facilitates citizen engagement in the decision-making process, enabling people to seek information pertinent to their interests and rights.\n3. **Independent Oversight**: The establishment of an independent Information Commission ensures that complaints related to information access are addressed, further holding authorities accountable.\n4. **Access to Information on Public Resources**: Citizens can obtain details about the use of public funds by both government and NGOs, allowing for scrutiny of public service delivery.\n\nOrganizations like USAID PROGATI and MRDI have been instrumental in training journalists and NGOs, enhancing their capability to utilize the RTI effectively. This collaborative effort fosters a culture of accountability, encouraging the public to demand transparency from those in power. Overall, the RTI act serves as a vital tool in strengthening democracy and ensuring responsible governance in Bangladesh.",

This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

They can help facilitate access to information for underprivileged citizens.\n\n3. **Training and Resources**: NGOs, with support from organizations like USAID and MRDI, have been provided training to better understand and utilize the RTI law effectively in their activities, empowering them to seek and use information more strategically than individual citizens may typically do.\n\nIn essence, while both citizens and NGOs can request information under the RTI Act, NGOs are positioned to leverage this access in broader social justice and advocacy efforts.",

Copy of Whistleblower (protection) Act, 2011 \n \n \n \n3\n \nIntroduction \nThe Right to Information Act, 2009 shines as a milestone in the path of \nBangladesh’s democracy. This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field",

This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people.

If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA.

            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8.

For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA.

Copy of Whistleblower (protection) Act, 2011 \n \n \n \n3\n \nIntroduction \nThe Right to Information Act, 2009 shines as a milestone in the path of \nBangladesh’s democracy. This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the "

This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"

This was enacted to empower the people and to \nensure transparency and accountabili ty in the government, autonomous and \nnon-government and foreign aided organizations. This law recognizes the \npeople’s right to obtain information. It also asks the authorities to preserve all \nkinds of information. A healthy practice of this law is expected to ensure good \ngovernance in the society. \n \nThe law creates legal space for voluntary disclosure of information, a position \nof a responsible officer to provide information, the scope for appeal and \ncreation of an independent information co mmission to ensure implementation \nof the law. \n \nTo implement the law, some non-gov ernment organizations (NGOs) and the \npress play very important roles. For the last three years, the Management and \nResources Development Initiative (MRDI) and USAID PROGATI have been \nproviding training to NGO workers and journalists on RTI and how to utilize \nthe act. \n \nThe foreign aided organizations act as both information provider and \ninformation seeker, as they represent the civil society. Assisting PROGATI, \nthese organizations have been reviewing the public service delivery at local \nlevels through citizen monitoring, service commitments and social audit. The \nNGOs can utilize the RTI law to review the service sector and also to build \npublic awareness in their working areas. \n \nThe journalists can utilize the law to  collect adequate information on public-\nprivate revenue and expenditure, decisions and projects in the interest of the \npublic and publish them. \n \nThis project had aimed at providing the media and NGOs both theoretical \nknowledge on the RTI and technical assistance at application level. In the \nthree years after the law was passed, some experiences have been gathered. \nThis book mainly reviews some important parts of the act along with relevant \nexamples. The trainers who assisted the journalists and NGO shared some of \ntheir experience, learning and recommendations. Both information providers \nand seekers will get some conceptual direction based on real experience from \nthis book. \n \nThe book was prepared in consultation with Mr Nepal Chandra Sarkar first \never secretary of the Information Commission who retired very recently and \nFarid Hossain Bureau Chief of Associated Press. \n \nWe express our gratitude to the USAID PROGATI for supporting the \npublication of this book and the implementation of related activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nRight to Information Law \nis the people’s law \n \n \n5\n \n \nA government’s job revolves around improvement and welfare of the people using the \nresources belonging to the people. If the people do not have access to information helpful to \nthe political, economic and social rights, they can not fully participate in the state’s decision \nmaking process. The right to access to such information is defined as the right to \ninformation. According to article  4 of the Right to Information law (RTI), subject to the ",
            "\nprovisions of this law, every citizen shall have  the right to information from the authority, and \nthe authority shall, on demand from a citizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe foundation of democracy is citizen participa tion. The Bangladesh Constitution’s Article \n39 terms the freedom of thought, conscience and speech as one of the basic rights of the \ncitizens. Clause Article 7 (a) of the constitution states: the people are the owners of all the \npowers of the state. Therefore, the information vested with the government is owned by the \npeople. Information is not the property of the government only. The RTI law thus properly \nreflects the principles and basic rights given to the people in the constitution. \n \nSide by side with the government, different NGOs have devoted themselves to the welfare of \nthe marginalized and deprived people. These organizations are implementing various \nprojects for peoples’ welfare with funds from the government and donors. The people have \nthe right to know about money that is spent for their welfare. \n \nThe RTI law ensures the Bangladeshi citizen hi s or her right to get the information on all \nactivities, policy, decisions, expenditur e and revenue of the government, autonomous, and \nNGOs using government and foreign donations. \n \nFollowing are the principles of right to information, which are accommodated in the RTI law: \n1. Maximum information disclosure \n2. Proactive disclosure of information  \n3. Ensuring transparency and accountability \n4. Limiting the exemption \n5. Easing access to information \n6. Providing information free or at a rational cost \n \nSome special aspects of RTI law that need to be highlighted are: \n \nFirstly, the RTI law itself is not a solution. It is a step. For instance, one cannot get a new \nelectricity or water supply connection using the RTI law. But one can learn who the persons \nresponsible to provide such connections are. Or what is the progress after one has applied \nfor electricity connection? When does one get the connection? So on. \n \nSecondly, the RTI law may be a medium to find solution to a problem.  For instance, an \nindividual may seek information on the number  of doctors and nurses required in a public \nhospital and how many have been recruited. He or she may seek information on the regular \npresence of teachers at a public school and so on. \n \nThirdly, the RTI law may protect interest of all.   It may not be possible for all citizens to \nseek public information and they may turn to others for help. The marginalized people of the \ncountry may obtain public information with help from the NGOs or the civil societies. For \ninstance, the country’s Dalit and Harizon communities are most rights deprived people. Their \nchildren often do not get the scope to get admission into schools. These communities may \nutilize the RTI law with help from the civil societies to ask the authorities why their children \ncannot get admission into schools? Who or what are preventing them? \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe power of RTI law: \n‐ Under RTI, a citizen enjoys the right to get the same information that a parliament \ncan obtain. Whatever information is placed at the parliament, can be availed to the \npublic. If the information on the corruption of Padma Bridge Project is placed in the \nparliament, the people will get it too. \n‐ There is a provision for supplying informat ion free of cost. According to the Article \n8(5), in consultation with the Information Commission, the government may exempt \nan individual or a class of individuals or any other class from paying a fee. \n‐  A citizen needs not to explain why he is asking for the information. \n‐ No application can be fully rejected. Article 7 demands that if one requests \ninformation that is related to non-publishable ones, the authorities would have to \nprovide the parts which are publishable. \n \nUnder these considerations, the RTI law is actually the peoples’ law. \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two \nThe applied aspects \nof the RTI law \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nA. Owner and carrier of information is the Authority. \nAll government, autonomous and statutory bodies and government and foreign funded \nNGOs are under the pur",
            "view of this law. \n \nThe Authority defined by the act is: \ni) Any organization constituted in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s \nRepublic of Bangladesh; \nii) Any ministry, division or office est ablished under the Rules of Business made under \narticle 55(6) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; \niii) Any statutory body or institution established by or under any Act; \niv) Any private organization or institution run by government financing or with aid in grant \nfrom the government fund; \nv) Any organization or institution that undertakes public functions in accordance with \nany contract made on behalf of the government or made with any public \norganization or institution; or \nvi) Any organization or institution as may be notified in the official Gazette from time to \ntime by the Government; \n \nThe law practically puts all types of organization using public funds in the definition of \nAuthority. This enables anyone asking for information from the ministries, departments, \ndistrict administration, upazila administration, schools receiving public fund, government \neducational institutions, project offices or NGOs. \n \n \n \nThere is also a scope for getting information from private organizations. \nAlthough the law exempts private bodies, one can seek information of a private \norganization that is registered with a government body. For instance, the Bangladesh \nAudit and Comptroller General’s Office audits all government expenditure, including that of \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority (BTRC). The private telecommunication \ncompanies are registered with the BTRC. While an individual would not be able to seek \ninformation from these companies, he or she can obtain audit reports on the BTRC from \nthe Bangladesh Audit and Comptroller General’s Office where information on the telecom \ncompanies are available. \nSimilarly at the rural level various private multipurpose societies are operating lending \nactivities—the information of which would be available with the Microcredit Regulatory \nAuthority or the Rural Development and Cooperatives Welfare Ministry. \n \n \nSome organizations exempted under the law \nThere are certain organizations dealing with national security and intelligence which are \nexempted under the act. However if there are cases of corruption and human rights violation \nin these bodies, one can seek information on these subjects from them. These bodies are \ninstructed to supply the information within 30 days upon approval of the Information \nCommission.  \n \n \n \n9\n \nThe exempted organizations are:  \n1. National Security Intelligence (NSI) \n2. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) \n3. Defense Intelligence Units \n4. Criminal Investigation Depar tment (CID), Bangladesh Police \n5. Special Security Force (SSF) \n6. Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue \n7. Special Branch, Bangladesh Police \n8. Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) \n \nEnsuring right to information is the responsibility of the Authority: \n‐ Information has to be properly preserved in the form of catalog and index \n‐ Develop policy and system to preserve information \n‐ Prepare citizens’ charte r to ensure transparency \n‐ Gradually ensure maximum use of information and communication technology  \n‐ Each authority must have their own website \n‐ Preserve and maintain copies of priority wise information  \n‐ All authorities would computerize all informat ion within a rational time limit and create \na country-wide network to ensure access of the people \n‐ All authorities would follow directives of the Information Commission in preserving \nand managing information \n \n \nThe USAID PROGATI and MRDI in 2012 provided technical assistance to 39 NGOs in \nframing information disclosure policy in line with the RTI Act to ensure highest information \ndisclosure, transparency and accountability. \n \n \n \n \nB. Information and Right to Information \nRight to information: Subject to the provision of the law, every citizen shall have the \nright to information from the authority,  and the authority shall, on demand from a \ncitizen, be bound to provide him with the information. \n \nThe RTI law has ensured the people’s right to  have information from the authority in \nwider context and through various mediums. For instance, an authority may keep its \ninformation on structure and activities in books, pamphlets, design, map, agreement, \ndata, log book, order, advertisement, documents, photographs, audio, video, \nmachine readable documents etc. \n \nAccording to RTI, a citizen has: \nThe right to see information at field"
